### Phase 2: Implementation Strategy
1. **Core Engines**: We will build 10 robust engines (Anxiety, Burnout, etc.) instead of 100 flat forms.
2. **Metadata Layer**: Each test will be a "wrapper" over an engine, injected with specific titles and context tags.
3. **Intelligence Layer**: Deterministic routing based on risk profiles and clinical thresholds.

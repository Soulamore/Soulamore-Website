# Cursor Rules for Soulamore Website

This project uses a custom AI agent framework located in the `.agent` directory. To ensure consistency across different IDEs and assistants, Cursor must follow the same rules as the primary AI assistant.

## Mandatory Instructions for Cursor AI

1. **Read Core Rules First:** Before making *any* code changes, answering architectural questions, or generating new files, you **MUST** read the core rule file at `.agent/GEMINI.md`. This file contains the highest-priority rules for this project.
2. **Follow Agent Routing:** Based on the instructions in `.agent/GEMINI.md`, identify the appropriate specialist agent for the user's request (e.g., `frontend-specialist.md`, `backend-specialist.md`).
3. **Read Specialist Rules:** Read the corresponding markdown file for the chosen agent in the `.agent/` directory and strictly follow its principles. Do not write generic code.
4. **Follow Clean Code Standards:** All code written must adhere to the rules defined in `.agent/skills/clean-code/SKILL.md`.
5. **Honor the Socratic Gate:** If a user request is complex, vague, or involves new features, you must STOP and ask clarifying questions before writing code, as defined in the Socratic Gate protocol in `.agent/GEMINI.md`.
6. **Use Checklists:** When asked to verify, audit, or perform final checks, follow the Enforcement Protocols and check the `.agent/scripts/` directory for validation tools.

> **Note to Cursor AI:** Do not ignore these rules. Treat the `.agent/GEMINI.md` file as your primary system prompt for this workspace.

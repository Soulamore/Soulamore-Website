Therefore, the context in which an issue is presented within\na film or video may be given consideration. Factors such as the setting of a work\n(historical, fantasy, realistic, contemporary etc.), the manner of presentation of\nthe content, the apparent intention of the content, the original production date of\nthe content, and any special merits of the work may influence the classification\ndecision.\n(b) Theme:\nClassification decisions may take into the theme of any content but will depend\nsignificantly on the treatment of that theme, especially the sensitivity of its\npresentation. The most challenging themes (for example, drug misuse, violence,\npedophilia, sex, racial or communal hatred or violence etc.) are unlikely to be\nappropriate at the junior levels of classification.\n(c) Tone and impact:"

These concerns are listed in alphabetical order, and\nare to be read with the four General Guidelines listed in Part I —\n(a) Discrimination:\nThe categorical classification of content shall take into account the impact of a\nfilm on matters such as caste, race, gender, religion, disability or sexuality that\nmay arise in a wide range of works, and the classification decision will take\naccount of the strength or impact of their inclusion.\n(b) Psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking and tobacco:\nFilms or serials, etc. that as a whole portray misuse of psychotropic substances,\nliquor, smoking and tobacco would qualify for a higher category of\nclassification.\n(c) Imitable behaviour:\n(1) Classification decisions may take into account any portrayal of criminal\nand violent behaviour with weapons.\n(2) Portrayal of potentially dangerous behaviour that are likely to incite the\ncommission of any offence (including suicide, and infliction of self-harm)\nand that children and young people may potentially copy, shall receive a\nhigher classification.\n(3) Films or serials with song and dance scenes comprising lyrics and gestures\nthat have sexual innuendos would receive a higher classification.\n(d) Language:"

The use of language, dialect, idioms and euphemisms vary\nfrom region to region and are culture-specific. This factor has to be taken\ninto account during the process of classification of a work in a particular\ncategory.\n(2) Language that people may find offensive includes the use of expletives. The\nextent of offence may vary according to age, gender, race, background,\nbeliefs and expectations of the target audience from the work as well as the\ncontext, region and language in which the word, expression or gesture is\nused.\n(3) It is not possible to set out a comprehensive list of words, expressions or\ngestures that are acceptable at each category in every Indian language. The\nadvice at different classification levels, therefore, provides general guidance\nto consider while judging the level of classification for content, based on\nthis guideline.\n(e) Nudity:\n(1) No content that is prohibited by law at the time being in force can be\npublished or transmitted.\n(2) Nudity with a sexual context will receive a higher classification of “A”.\n(f) Sex:\nNo content that is prohibited by law at the time being in force can be published\nor transmitted. The classification of content in various ratings from U/A 16+ to\n“A” shall depend upon the portrayal of non-explicit (implicit) to explicit\ndepiction of sexual behaviour.\n(g) Violence:\nClassification decisions shall take account of the degree and nature of violence\nin a work."

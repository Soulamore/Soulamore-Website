            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure is a self-rated measure that assesses mental health domains that are\nimportant across psychiatric diagnoses. It is intended to help clinicians identify additional areas of inquiry that may have significant\nimpact on the child’s treatment and prognosis. In addition, the measure may be used to track changes in the child’s symptom\npresentation over time.\nThis child-rated version of the measure consists of 25 questions that assess 12 psychiatric domains, including depression, anger,\nirritability, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, inattention, suicidal ideation/attempt, psychosis, sleep disturbance, repetitive\nthoughts and behaviors, and substance use. Each item asks the child, age 11–17, to rate how much (or how often) he or she has\nbeen bothered by the specific symptom during the past 2 weeks. The measure was found to be clinically useful and had good test-\nretest reliability in the DSM-5 Field Trials conducted in pediatric clinical samples across the United States.\nScoring and Interpretation\nNineteen of the 25 items on the measure are each rated on a 5-point scale (0=none or not at all; 1=slight or rare, less than a day or\ntwo; 2=mild or several days; 3=moderate or more than half the days; and 4=severe or nearly every day). The suicidal ideation,\nsuicide attempt, and substance abuse items are each rated on a “Yes or No” scale. The score on each item within a domain should\nbe reviewed. Because additional inquiry is based on the highest score on any item within a domain, the clinician is asked to indicate\nthat score in the “Highest Domain Score” column. Table 1 (below) outlines threshold scores that may be used to guide further\ninquiry for the domains. With the exception of inattention and psychosis, a rating of mild (i.e., 2) or greater on any item within a\ndomain that is scored on the 5-point scale may serve as a guide for additional inquiry and follow-up to determine if a more detailed\nassessment for that domain is needed. The DSM-5-TR Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom measures listed in Table 1 may be used as a\nresource to provide more detailed information on the symptoms associated with some of the Level 1 domains.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the child’s symptom presentation over time, it is recommended that the measure be completed at regular\nintervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high scores on\na particular domain may indicate significant and problematic symptoms for the child that might warrant further assessment,\ntreatment, and follow-up. Clinical judgment should guide decision making.\nTable 1: DSM-5-TR Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure—Child Age 11–17: domains, thresholds for further\ninquiry, and associated Level 2 measures\nDomain Domain Name Threshold to guide DSM-5-TR Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure available online\nfurther inquiry\nI. Somatic Symptoms Mild or greater LEVEL 2—Somatic Symptom—Child Age 11–17 (Patient Health Questionnaire\nSomatic Symptom Severity [PHQ-15])\nII.

Mania Mild or greater LEVEL 2—Mania—Child Age 11–17 (Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale [ASRM])\nVIII. Anxiety Mild or greater LEVEL 2—Anxiety—Child Age 11–17 (PROMIS Emotional Distress—Anxiety—\nPediatric Item Bank)\nIX. Psychosis Slight or greater None\nX.

Suicidal Ideation/ Yes/ None\nSuicide Attempts Don’t Know\n1Not validated for children by the PROMIS group but found to have acceptable test-retest reliability with child informants in the DSM-5 Field Trial.\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

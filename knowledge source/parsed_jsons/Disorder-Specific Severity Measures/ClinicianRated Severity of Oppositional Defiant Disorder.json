            "content": "The APA is offering a number of “emerging measures” for further research and\nclinical evaluation. These patient assessment measures were developed to be\nadministered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress.\nThey should be used in research and evaluation as potentially useful tools to\nenhance clinical decision-making and not as the sole basis for making a clinical\ndiagnosis. Instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are\nprovided; further background information can be found in DSM-5-TR. The APA\nrequests that clinicians and researchers provide further data on the\ninstruments’ usefulness in characterizing patient status and improving patient\ncare at http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Feedback-Form.aspx.\nMeasure: Clinician-Rated Severity of Oppositional Defiant Disorder\nRights granted: This measure may not be modified absent written permission\nfrom APA. This measure can be reproduced, either electronically or in print\nformats, without permission by researchers and by clinicians solely for use with\ntheir patients in private-practice, research, or hospital settings. For the avoidance\nof doubt, this includes that Clinicians may upload this instrument into their own\npre-existing electronic health software systems for patient assessment and\nrecords when done solely for their own use with their patients.\nRights holder: American Psychiatric Association\nTo request permission to include this measure in a commercial electronic health\nrecord system (EHR) or application, to translate the measure, or for any other\nuse beyond what is stipulated above, please contact:\nhttps://websrvapps.psychiatry.org/requestform/default.aspx"

All rights reserved.\nThis material can be reproduced without permission by researchers and by clinicians for use with their patients.\nInstructions to Clinicians\nThe Clinician-Rated Severity of Oppositional Defiant Disorder assesses the severity of the OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT\nsymptoms for the individual based on their pervasiveness across settings. The measure is intended to capture\nmeaningful variation in the severity of symptoms, which may help with treatment planning and prognostic decision-\nmaking. The measure is completed by the clinician at the time of the clinical assessment. The clinician is asked to rate\nthe severity of oppositional defiant problems as experienced by the individual in the past seven days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nThe Clinician-Rated Severity of Oppositional Defiant Disorder is rated on a 4-point scale (Level 0=None; 1=Mild;\n2=Moderate; and 3=Severe). The clinician is asked to review all available information for the individual and, based on his\nor her clinical judgment, select (✓) the level that most accurately describes the severity of the individual’s condition.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the individual’s symptom severity over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals as\nclinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high\nscores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the individual that might warrant\nfurther assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision."

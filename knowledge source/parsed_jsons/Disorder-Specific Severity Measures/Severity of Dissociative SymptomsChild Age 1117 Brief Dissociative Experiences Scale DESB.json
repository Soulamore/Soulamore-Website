            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe Brief Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-B)—Modified is an 8-item measure that assesses the severity of\ndissociative experiences in children ages 11–17. The measure is completed by the child upon receiving a diagnosis\nof a dissociative disorder (or clinically significant dissociative symptoms) and thereafter, prior to follow-up visits\nwith the clinician. Each item asks the child receiving care to rate the severity of his or her dissociative experiences\nduring the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=Once or twice; 2=Almost every day; 3=About\nonce a day, and 4=More than once a day). The total score can range from 0 to 32, with higher scores indicating\ngreater severity of dissociative experiences. The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure\nduring the clinical interview and indicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.”\nThe raw scores on the 8 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score. In addition, the clinician is asked to\ncalculate and use the average total score. The average total score reduces the overall score to a 5-point scale,\nwhich allows the clinician to think of the severity of the child’s brief dissociative experiences in terms of none (0),\nmild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), or extreme (4). The average total score is calculated by dividing the raw total\nscore by number of items in the measure (i.e., 8). The use of the average total score was found to be reliable, easy\nto use, and clinically useful to the clinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials.\nNote: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the measure should not be\ncalculated. Therefore, the child should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 or 2\nitems are left unanswered, you are asked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by\nsumming scores of the items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the\ntotal number of items on the DES-B (i.e., 8) and divide the value by the number of items that were actually\nanswered (i.e., either 6 or 7). The formula to prorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:\n____________(Raw sum x 8)______________\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the severity of the child’s brief dissociative experiences over time, the measure may be\ncompleted at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and\ntreatment status. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas\nfor the child that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should\nguide your decision.\nInstructions, scoring, and frequency of use on this page only: Copyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

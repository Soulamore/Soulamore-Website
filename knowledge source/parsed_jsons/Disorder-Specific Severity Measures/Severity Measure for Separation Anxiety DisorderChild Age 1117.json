            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe Severity Measure for Separation Anxiety Disorder—Child Age 11–17 is a 10-item measure that assesses the\nseverity of symptoms of separation anxiety disorder in children and adolescents. The measure was designed to be\ncompleted by the child upon receiving a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder (or clinically significant\nseparation anxiety disorder symptoms) and thereafter, prior to follow-up visits with the clinician. Each item asks\nthe child to rate the severity of his or her separation anxiety disorder during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=Never; 1=Occasionally; 2=Half of the time; 3=Most of the\ntime, and 4=All of the time). The total score can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity\nof separation anxiety disorder. The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure during the\nclinical interview and indicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw\nscores on the 10 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score. In addition, the clinician is asked to\ncalculate and use the average total score. The average total score reduces the overall score to a 5-point scale,\nwhich allows the clinician to think of the severity of the child’s separation anxiety disorder in terms of none (0),\nmild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), or extreme (4). The use of the average total score was found to be reliable, easy\nto use, and clinically useful to the clinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials. The average total score is calculated by\ndividing the raw total score by number of items in the measure (i.e., 10).\nNote: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the measure should not be calculated. Therefore,\nthe child should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 or 2 items are left unanswered,\nyou are asked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by summing the scores of items that\nwere answered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the total number of items on the\nSeverity Measure for Separation Anxiety Disorder (i.e., 10) and divide the value by the number of items that were\nactually answered (i.e., 8 or 9). The formula to prorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:\n____________(Raw sum x 10)_____________\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the severity of the child’s separation anxiety disorder over time, the measure may be\ncompleted at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and\ntreatment status. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas\nfor the child that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should\nguide your decision.\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

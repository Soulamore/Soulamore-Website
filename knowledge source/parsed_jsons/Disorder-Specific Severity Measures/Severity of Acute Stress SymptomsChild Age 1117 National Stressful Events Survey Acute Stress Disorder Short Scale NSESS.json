            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS) is a 7-item measure that assesses\nthe severity symptoms of acute stress disorder in children ages 11–17 following an extremely stressful event or\nexperience. The measure was designed to be completed by the child upon receiving a diagnosis of acute stress\ndisorder (or clinically significant acute stress disorder symptoms) and thereafter, prior to follow-up visits with the\nclinician. Each item asks the child to rate the severity of his or her acute stress disorder during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=A little bit; 2=Moderately; 3=Quite a bit, and\n4=Extremely). The total score can range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating greater severity of acute stress\ndisorder. The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure during the clinical interview and\nindicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 7 items\nshould be summed to obtain a total raw score. In addition, the clinician is asked to calculate and use the average\ntotal score. The average total score reduces the overall score to a 5-point scale, which allows the clinician to think\nof the severity of the child’s acute stress disorder in terms of none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), or\nextreme (4). The use of the average total score was found to be reliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to the\nclinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials. The average total score is calculated by dividing the raw total score by number\nof items in the measure (i.e., 7).\nNote: If 2 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the measure should not be calculated. Therefore,\nthe child should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 item is left unanswered, you are\nasked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by summing the scores of items that were\nanswered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the total number of items on the NSESSS—\nAcute Stress Disorder (i.e., 7) and divide the value by the number of items that were actually answered (i.e., 6).\nThe formula to prorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:\n____________(Raw sum x 7)______________\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the severity of the child’s acute stress disorder over time, the measure may be completed at\nregular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status.\nConsistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the child that\nmight warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

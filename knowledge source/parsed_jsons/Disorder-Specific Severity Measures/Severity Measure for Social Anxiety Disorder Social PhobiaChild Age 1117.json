            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe Severity Measure for Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)—Child Age 11–17 is a 10-item measure that\nassesses the severity of symptoms of social anxiety (social phobia) in children and adolescents. The measure was\ndesigned to be completed by the child upon receiving a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (or clinically significant\nsocial anxiety symptoms) and thereafter, prior to follow-up visits with the clinician. Each item asks the child\nreceiving care to rate the severity of his or her social anxiety disorder (social phobia) during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=Never; 1=Occasionally; 2=Half of the time; 3=Most of the\ntime, and 4=All of the time). The total score can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity\nof social anxiety disorder (social phobia). The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure\nduring the clinical interview and indicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.”\nThe raw scores on the 10 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score. In addition, the clinician is asked\nto calculate and use the average total score. The average total score reduces the overall score to a 5-point scale,\nwhich allows the clinician to think of the severity of the child’s social anxiety disorder (social phobia) in terms of\nnone (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), or extreme (4). The use of the average total score was found to be\nreliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to the clinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials. The average total score is\ncalculated by dividing the raw total score by number of items in the measure (i.e., 10).\nNote: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the measure should not be\ncalculated. Therefore, the child should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 or 2 items\nare left unanswered, you are asked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by summing\nthe scores of items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the total\nnumber of items on the Severity Measure for Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) (i.e., 10) and divide the value\nby the number of items that were actually answered (i.e., 8 or 9). The formula to prorate the partial raw score to\nTotal Raw Score is:\n___________(Raw sum x 10)______________\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the severity of the child’s social anxiety disorder (social phobia) over time, the measure may\nbe completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and\ntreatment status. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas\nfor the child that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should\nguide your decision.\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

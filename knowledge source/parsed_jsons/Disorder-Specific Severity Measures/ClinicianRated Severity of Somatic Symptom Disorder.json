These patient assessment measures were developed to be\nadministered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress.\nThey should be used in research and evaluation as potentially useful tools to\nenhance clinical decision-making and not as the sole basis for making a clinical\ndiagnosis. Instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are\nprovided; further background information can be found in DSM-5-TR. The APA\nrequests that clinicians and researchers provide further data on the\ninstruments’ usefulness in characterizing patient status and improving patient\ncare at http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Feedback-Form.aspx.\nMeasure: Clinician-Rated Severity of Somatic Symptom Disorder\nRights granted: This measure may not be modified absent written permission\nfrom APA.

All rights reserved.\nThis material can be reproduced without permission by researchers and by clinicians for use with their patients.\nInstructions to Clinicians\nThe Clinician-Rated Severity of Somatic Symptom Disorder is a 3-item measure that assesses the severity of the individual's\nmisattributions, excessive concerns, and/or preoccupations with the somatic symptom(s). The measure is intended to capture\nmeaningful variation in the severity of symptoms, which may help with treatment planning and prognostic decision-making.\nThe measure is completed by the clinician at the time of the clinical assessment. Each item asks the clinician to rate the\nseverity of each symptom as experienced by the individual in the past seven days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=A little bit; 2=Somewhat; 3=Quite a bit; and 4=Very\nmuch). The measure has a range in total raw score from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater severity. The clinician is\nasked to review all available information for the individual and, based on his or her clinical judgment, select (✓) the level that\nmost accurately describes the severity of the individual’s condition. The clinician is then asked to indicate the score for each\nitem in the “Item score” column provided. The raw scores on the 3 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score. In\naddition, the clinician is asked to calculate and use the average total score. The average total score is calculated by dividing\nthe total raw score by the number of items on the measure (i.e., 3). The average total score is comparable to the 5-point\nscale, which allows the clinician to think of the severity of the individual’s condition in terms of none (0), mild (1), moderate\n(2), severe (3), or extreme (4).\nNote: If 1 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the measure should not be calculated. Therefore, the\nindividual should be encouraged to complete both items on the measure.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the individual’s symptom severity over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals as\nclinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high scores on\na particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the individual that might warrant further assessment,\ntreatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision."

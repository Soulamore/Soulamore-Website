            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe Severity Measure for Agoraphobia—Child Age 11–17 is a 10-item measure that assesses the severity of\nsymptoms of agoraphobia in children and adolescents. The measure was designed to be completed by the child\nupon receiving a diagnosis of agoraphobia (or clinically significant agoraphobia symptoms), and thereafter, prior\nto follow-up visits with the clinician. Each item asks the child to rate the severity of his or her agoraphobia during\nthe past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=Never; 1=Occasionally; 2=Half of the time; 3=Most of the\ntime, and 4=All of the time). The total score can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity\nof agoraphobia. The clinician is asked to review the score on each item on the measure during the clinical\ninterview and indicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on\nthe 10 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score. In addition, the clinician is asked to calculate and use\nthe average total score. The average total score reduces the overall score to a 5-point scale, which allows the\nclinician to think of the severity of the child’s agoraphobia in terms of none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3),\nor extreme (4). The use of the average total score was found to be reliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to the\nclinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials. The average total score is calculated by dividing the raw total score by number\nof items in the measure (i.e., 10).\nNote: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the measure should not be calculated. Therefore,\nthe child receiving care should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 or 2 items are left\nunanswered, you are asked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by summing the scores\nof items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the total number of\nitems on the Severity Measure for Agoraphobia (i.e., 10) and divide the value by the number of items that were\nactually answered (i.e., 8 or 9). The formula to prorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:\n____________(Raw sum x 10)_____________\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the severity of the child’s agoraphobia over time, the measure may be completed at regular\nintervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status.\nConsistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the child that\nmight warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

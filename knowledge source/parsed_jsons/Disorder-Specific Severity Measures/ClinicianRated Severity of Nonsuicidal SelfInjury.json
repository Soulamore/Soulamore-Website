These patient assessment measures were developed to be\nadministered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress.\nThey should be used in research and evaluation as potentially useful tools to\nenhance clinical decision-making and not as the sole basis for making a clinical\ndiagnosis. Instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are\nprovided; further background information can be found in DSM-5-TR. The APA\nrequests that clinicians and researchers provide further data on the\ninstruments’ usefulness in characterizing patient status and improving patient\ncare at http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Feedback-Form.aspx.\nMeasure: Clinician-Rated Severity of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury\nRights granted: This measure may not be modified absent written permission\nfrom APA. This measure can be reproduced, either electronically or in print\nformats, without permission by researchers and by clinicians solely for use with\ntheir patients in private-practice, research, or hospital settings.

The measure is intended to capture meaningful variation in\nthe severity of symptoms, which may help with treatment planning and prognostic decision-making. The measure is\ncompleted by the clinician at the time of the clinical assessment. The clinician is asked to rate the severity of the\nnonsuicidal self-injurious behavior as experienced by the individual in the past year.\nScoring and Interpretation\nThe Clinician-Rated Severity of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury is rated on a 5-point scale (Level 0=None; 1=Subthreshold; 2=Mild;\n3=Moderate; and 4=Severe). The clinician is asked to review all available information for the individual and, based on his\nor her clinical judgment, select (✓) the level that most accurately describes the severity of the individual’s condition.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the individual’s symptom severity over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals as\nclinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high\nscores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the individual that might warrant\nfurther assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision."

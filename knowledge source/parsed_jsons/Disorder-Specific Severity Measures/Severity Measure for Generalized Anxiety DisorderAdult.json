            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe Severity Measure for Generalized Anxiety Disorder—Adult is a 10-item measure that assesses the severity of\ngeneralized anxiety disorder in individuals age 18 and older. The measure was designed to be completed by an\nindividual upon receiving a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (or clinically significant generalized anxiety\nsymptoms) and thereafter, prior to follow-up visits with the clinician. Each item asks the individual to rate the\nseverity of his or her generalized anxiety disorder during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=Never; 1=Occasionally; 2=Half of the time; 3=Most of the\ntime, and 4=All of the time). The total score can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity\nof generalized anxiety disorder. The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure during the\nclinical interview and indicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw\nscores on the 10 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score. In addition, the clinician is asked to\ncalculate and use the average total score. The average total score reduces the overall score to a 5-point scale,\nwhich allows the clinician to think of the severity of the individual’s generalized anxiety disorder in terms of none\n(0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), or extreme (4). The use of the average total score was found to be reliable,\neasy to use, and clinically useful to the clinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials. The average total score is calculated by\ndividing the raw total score by number of items in the measure (i.e., 10).\nNote: If 3 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the measure should not be calculated. Therefore,\nthe individual receiving care should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 or 2 items\nare left unanswered, you are asked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by summing\nthe scores of items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the total\nnumber of items on the Severity Measure for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (i.e., 10) and divide the value by the\nnumber of items that were actually answered (i.e., 8 or 9). The formula to prorate the partial raw score to Total\nRaw Score is:\n____________(Raw sum x 10)_____________\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the severity of the individual’s generalized anxiety disorder over time, the measure may be\ncompleted at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and\ntreatment status. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas\nfor the individual that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should\nguide your decision.\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

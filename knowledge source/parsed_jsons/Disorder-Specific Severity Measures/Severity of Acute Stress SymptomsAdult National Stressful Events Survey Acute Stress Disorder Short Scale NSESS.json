            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESSS) is a 7-item measure that assesses\nthe severity symptoms of acute stress disorder in individuals age 18 and older following an extremely stressful\nevent or experience. The measure was designed to be completed by an individual upon receiving a diagnosis of\nacute stress disorder (or clinically significant acute stress disorder symptoms) and thereafter, prior to follow-up\nvisits with the clinician. Each item asks the individual receiving care to rate the severity of his or her acute stress\ndisorder during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all; 1=A little bit; 2=Moderately; 3=Quite a bit, and\n4=Extremely). The total score can range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating greater severity of acute stress\ndisorder. The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure during the clinical interview and\nindicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 7 items\nshould be summed to obtain a total raw score. In addition, the clinician is asked to calculate and use the average\ntotal score. The average total score reduces the overall score to a 5-point scale, which allows the clinician to think\nof the severity of the individual’s acute stress disorder in terms of none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), or\nextreme (4). The use of the average total score was found to be reliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to the\nclinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials. The average total score is calculated by dividing the raw total score by number\nof items in the measure (i.e., 7).\nNote: If 2 or more items are left unanswered, the total score on the measure should not be calculated. Therefore,\nthe individual receiving care should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 item is left\nunanswered, you are asked to calculate a prorated score. The prorated score is calculated by summing the scores\nof items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Multiply the partial raw score by the total number of\nitems on the NSESSS—Acute Stress Disorder (i.e., 7) and divide the value by the number of items that were\nactually answered (i.e., 6). The formula to prorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:\n____________(Raw sum x 7)______________\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the severity of the individual’s acute stress disorder over time, the measure may be\ncompleted at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and\ntreatment status. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas\nfor the individual that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should\nguide your decision.\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

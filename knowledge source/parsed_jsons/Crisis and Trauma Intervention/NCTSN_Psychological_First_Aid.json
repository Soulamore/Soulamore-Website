Principles and\ntechniques of Psychological First Aid meet four basic standards. They are:\n1. Consistent with research evidence on risk and resilience following trauma\n2. Applicable and practical in field settings\n3. Appropriate for developmental levels across the lifespan\n4. Culturally informed and delivered in a flexible manner\nPsychological First Aid does not assume that all survivors will develop severe mental\nhealth problems or long-term difficulties in recovery. Instead, it is based on an\nunderstanding that disaster survivors and others affected by such events will experience\na broad range of early reactions (for example, physical, psychological, behavioral,\nspiritual). Some of these reactions will cause enough distress to interfere with adaptive\ncoping, and recovery may be helped by support from compassionate and caring disaster\nresponders.\nWho is Psychological First Aid For?\nPsychological First Aid intervention strategies are intended for use with children,\nadolescents, parents/caretakers, families, and adults exposed to disaster or terrorism.\nPsychological First Aid can also be provided to first responders and other disaster relief\nworkers.\nWho Delivers Psychological First Aid?\nPsychological First Aid is designed for delivery by mental health and other disaster\nresponse workers who provide early assistance to affected children, families, and adults\nas part of an organized disaster response effort. These providers may be imbedded\nin a variety of response units, including first responder teams, incident command\nsystems, primary and emergency health care, school crisis response teams, faith-based\norganizations, Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT), Medical Reserve Corps,\nthe Citizens Corps, and other disaster relief organizations.\n1Psychological First Aid is supported by disaster mental health experts as the “acute intervention of choice” when re-\nsponding to the psychosocial needs of children, adults and families affected by disaster and terrorism. At the time of this\nwriting, this model requires systematic empirical support; however, because many of the components have been guided\nby research, there is consensus among experts that these components provide effective ways to help survivors manage\npost-disaster distress and adversities, and to identify those who may require additional services.\nPsychological First Aid - Field Operations Guide \u0018"

Mental health and\nother disaster response workers may be called upon to provide Psychological First\nAid in general population shelters, special needs shelters, field hospitals and medical\ntriage areas, acute care facilities (for example, Emergency Departments), staging areas\nor respite centers for first responders or other relief workers, emergency operations\ncenters, crisis hotlines or phone banks, feeding locations, disaster assistance service\ncenters, family reception and assistance centers, homes, businesses, and other community\nsettings. For more information on the challenges of providing Psychological First Aid in\nvarious service settings, see Appendix B.\nStrengths of Psychological First Aid\n Psychological First Aid includes basic information-gathering techniques to help\nproviders make rapid assessments of survivors’ immediate concerns and needs, and\nto implement supportive activities in a flexible manner.\n Psychological First Aid relies on field-tested, evidence-informed strategies that can\nbe provided in a variety of disaster settings.\n Psychological First Aid emphasizes developmentally and culturally appropriate\ninterventions for survivors of various ages and backgrounds.\n Psychological First Aid includes handouts that provide important information for\nyouth, adults, and families for their use over the course of recovery.\nBasic Objectives of Psychological First Aid\n Establish a human connection in a non-intrusive, compassionate manner.\n Enhance immediate and ongoing safety, and provide physical and emotional\ncomfort.\n Calm and orient emotionally overwhelmed or distraught survivors.\n Help survivors to tell you specifically what their immediate needs and concerns are,\nand gather additional information as appropriate.\n Offer practical assistance and information to help survivors address their immediate\nneeds and concerns.\n\u0018 National Child Traumatic Stress Network National Center for PTSD"

When you listen, focus on hearing\nwhat they want to tell you, and how you can be of help.\n Acknowledge the positive features of what the survivor has done to keep safe.\n Give information that directly addresses the survivor’s immediate goals and clarify\nanswers repeatedly as needed.\n Give information that is accurate and age-appropriate for your audience.\n When communicating through a translator or interpreter, look at and talk to the\nperson you are addressing, not at the translator or interpreter.\n Remember that the goal of Psychological First Aid is to reduce distress, assist with\ncurrent needs, and promote adaptive functioning, not to elicit details of traumatic\nexperiences and losses.\nSome Behaviors to Avoid\n Do not make assumptions about what survivors are experiencing or what they have\nbeen through.\n Do not assume that everyone exposed to a disaster will be traumatized.\n Do not pathologize. Most acute reactions are understandable and expectable given\nwhat people exposed to the disaster have experienced. Do not label reactions as\n“symptoms,” or speak in terms of “diagnoses,” “conditions,” “pathologies,” or\n“disorders.”\n Do not talk down to or patronize the survivor, or focus on his/her helplessness,\nweaknesses, mistakes, or disability. Focus instead on what the person has done\nthat is effective or may have contributed to helping others in need, both during the\ndisaster and in the present setting.\n Do not assume that all survivors want to talk or need to talk to you. Often, being\nphysically present in a supportive and calm way helps affected people feel safer and\nmore able to cope.\n Do not “debrief” by asking for details of what happened.\n Do not speculate or offer possibly inaccurate information.

Do not use extreme words like “terrified” or “horrified” because this may\nincrease their distress.\n Listen carefully and check in with the child to make sure you understand him/her.\n Be aware that children may show developmental regression in their behavior and\nuse of language.\n Match your language to the child’s developmental level. Younger children typically\nhave less understanding of abstract concepts like “death.” Use direct and simple\nlanguage as much as possible.\n Talk to adolescents “adult-to-adult,” so you give the message that you respect their\nfeelings, concerns, and questions.\n Reinforce these techniques with the child’s parents/caregivers to help them provide\nappropriate emotional support to their child.\nWorking with Older Adults\n Older adults have strengths as well as vulnerabilities. Many older adults have\nacquired effective coping skills over a lifetime of dealing with adversities.\n For those who may have a hearing difficulty, speak clearly and in a low pitch.\n Don’t make assumptions based only on physical appearance or age, for example,\nthat a confused elder has irreversible problems with memory, reasoning,\nor judgment. Reasons for apparent confusion may include: disaster-related\ndisorientation due to change in surroundings; poor vision or hearing; poor\nnutrition or dehydration; sleep deprivation; a medical condition or problems with\nmedications; social isolation; and feeling helpless or vulnerable.\n An older adult with a mental health disability may be more upset or confused\nin unfamiliar surroundings. If you identify such an individual, help to make\narrangements for a mental health consultation or referral.\nWorking With Survivors with Disabilities\n When needed, try to provide assistance in an area with little noise or other\nstimulation.\n Address the person directly, rather than the caretaker, unless direct communication\nis difficult.\nPsychological First Aid - Field Operations Guide \u0018"

You may also be working\nwith children, older adults and special populations, all of which require additional in-depth\nknowledge. In deciding whether to participate in disaster response, you should consider your\ncomfort level with this type of work, your current health, your family and work circumstances,\nand be prepared to engage in appropriate self-care. See Appendix C for more guidance in\nregard to these topics.\nEntering the Setting\nPsychological First Aid begins when a disaster response worker enters an emergency\nmanagement setting in the aftermath of a disaster (See Appendix B for descriptions of\nvarious service delivery sites). Successful entry involves working within the framework of an\nauthorized Incident Command System (ICS) in which roles and decision-making are clearly\ndefined. It is essential to establish communication and coordinate all activities with authorized\npersonnel or organizations that are managing the setting. Effective entry also includes learning\nas much as you can about the setting, for example, leadership, organization, policies and\nprocedures, security, and available support services. You need to have accurate information\nabout what is going to happen, what services are available, and where they can be found. This\ninformation needs to be gathered as soon as possible, given that providing such information is\noften critical to reducing distress and promoting adaptive coping.\nProviding Services\nIn some settings, Psychological First Aid may be provided in designated areas. In other\nsettings, providers may circulate around the facility to identify those who might need\nassistance. Focus your attention on how people are reacting and interacting in the setting.\nIndividuals who may need assistance include those showing signs of acute distress, including\nindividuals who are:\n Disoriented\n Confused\n Frantic or agitated\nPsychological First Aid - Field Operations Guide \u00183"

The components of\nproviding information, support, comfort, and safety can be applied to these spontaneous group\nsituations. For groups of children and adolescents, offering games for distraction can reduce\nanxiety and concern after hours and days in a shelter setting.\nWhen meeting with groups, keep the following in mind:\n Tailor the discussion to the group’s shared needs and concerns.\n Focus the discussion on problem-solving and applying coping strategies to immediate\nissues.\n Do not let discussion about concerns lapse into complaints.\n If an individual needs further support, offer to meet with him/her after the group\ndiscussion.\nMaintain a Calm Presence\nPeople take their cue from how others are reacting. By demonstrating calmness and clear\nthinking, you can help survivors feel that they can rely on you. Others may follow your lead\nin remaining focused, even if they do not feel calm, safe, effective, or hopeful. Psychological\nFirst Aid providers often model the sense of hope that survivors cannot always feel while they\nare still attempting to deal with what happened and current pressing concerns.\nBe Sensitive to Culture and Diversity\nProviders of Psychological First Aid must be sensitive to culture, ethnic, religious, racial, and\nlanguage diversity. Whether providing outreach or services, you should be aware of your own\nvalues and prejudices, and how these may agree with or differ from those of the community\nbeing served. Training in cultural competence can facilitate this awareness. Helping to\nmaintain or reestablish customs, traditions, rituals, family structure, gender roles, and social\nbonds is important in helping survivors cope with the impact of a disaster.

Contact and Engagement\nGoal:.To.respond.to.contacts.initiated.by.survivors,.or.to.initiate.contacts.in.a.non-\nintrusive,.compassionate,.and.helpful.manner.\nYour first contact with a survivor is important. If managed in a respectful and\ncompassionate way, you can establish an effective helping relationship and increase the\nperson’s receptiveness to further help. Your first priority should be to respond to survivors\nwho seek you out. If a number of people approach you simultaneously, make contact with\nas many individuals as you can. Even a brief look of interest and calm concern can be\ngrounding and helpful to people who are feeling overwhelmed or confused.\nCulture.Alert: The type of physical or personal contact considered appropriate may vary\nfrom person to person and across cultures and social groups, for example, how close to\nstand to someone, how much eye contact to make or whether or not to touch someone,\nespecially someone of the opposite sex. Unless you are familiar with the culture of the\nsurvivor, you should not approach too closely, make prolonged eye contact, or touch. You\nshould look for clues to a survivor’s need for “personal space,” and seek guidance about\ncultural norms from community cultural leaders who best understand local customs.\nIn working with family members, find out who is the spokesperson for the family and\ninitially address this person.\nSome survivors may not seek your help, but may benefit from assistance. When you\nidentify such persons, timing is important. Do not interrupt conversations. Do not assume\nthat people will respond to your outreach with immediate positive reactions. It may take\ntime for some survivors or bereaved persons to feel some degree of safety, confidence,\nand trust. If an individual declines your offer of help, respect his/her decision and indicate\nwhen and where to locate a Psychological First Aid provider later on.\nIntroduce Yourself/Ask about Immediate Needs\nIntroduce yourself with your name, title, and describe your role. Ask for permission to\ntalk to him/her, and explain that you are there to see if you can be of help. Unless given\npermission to do otherwise, address adult survivors using last names. Invite the person to\nsit, try to ensure some level of privacy for the conversation, and give the person your full\nattention. Speak softly and calmly. Refrain from looking around or being distracted. Find\nout whether there is any pressing problem that needs immediate attention. Immediate\nmedical concerns have the utmost priority.\nWhen making contact with children or adolescents, it is good practice to first make a\nconnection with a parent or accompanying adult to explain your role and seek permission.\nIf you speak with a child in distress when no adult is present, find a parent or caregiver as\nsoon as possible to let him/her know about your conversation.\nPsychological First Aid - Field Operations Guide \u00183"

However, maintaining the highest level of confidentiality possible in\nany conversation you have with survivors or disaster responders is extremely important.\nIf you are a professional who belongs to a category of mandated reporters, you should\nabide by state abuse and neglect reporting laws. You should also be aware of the Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the provisions related to\ndisaster and terrorism.

Safety and Comfort\nGoal:.To.enhance.immediate.and.ongoing.safety,.and.provide.physical.and.\nemotional.comfort.\nRestoration of a sense of safety is an important goal in the immediate aftermath of\ndisaster and terrorism. Promoting safety and comfort can reduce distress and worry.\nAssisting survivors in circumstances of missing loved ones, death of loved ones, death\nnotification and body identification is a critical component of providing emotional\ncomfort and support.\nComfort and safety can be supported in a number of ways, including helping survivors:\n Do things that are active (rather than passive waiting), practical (using available\nresources), and familiar (drawing on past experience).\n Get current, accurate and up-to-date information, while avoiding survivors’\nexposure to information that is inaccurate or excessively upsetting.\n Get connected with available practical resources.\n Get information about how responders are making the situation safer.\n Get connected with others who have shared similar experiences.\nEnsure Immediate Physical Safety\nMake sure that individuals and families are physically safe to the extent possible. If\nnecessary, reorganize the immediate environment to increase physical and emotional\nsafety. For example:\n Find the appropriate officials who can resolve safety concerns that are beyond your\ncontrol, such as threats, weapons, etc.\n Remove broken glass, sharp objects, furniture, spilled liquids, and other objects that\ncould cause people to trip and fall.\n Make sure that children have a safe area in which to play and that they are\nadequately supervised.\n Be aware and ensure the safety of survivors in a particular subgroup that may be\ntargeted for persecution based on their ethnicity, religion, or other affiliations.\nTo promote safety and comfort for survivors who are elderly or disabled, you can:\n Help make the physical environment safer (for example, try to ensure adequate\nlighting, and protect against slipping, tripping, and falling).\n Ask specifically about his/her needs for eyeglasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs,\nwalkers, canes, or other devices.

If possible,\nconsider things like temperature, lighting, air quality, access to furniture, and how\nthe furniture is arranged. In order to reduce feelings of helplessness or dependency,\nencourage survivors to participate in getting things needed for comfort (for example,\noffer to walk over to the supply area with the person rather than retrieving supplies for\nhim/her). Help survivors to soothe and comfort themselves and others around them.\nFor children, toys like soft teddy bears that they can hold and take care of can help\nthem to soothe themselves. However, avoid offering such toys if there are not enough\nto go around to all children who may request them. You can help children learn how to\ntake care of themselves by explaining how they can “care” for their toy (for example,\n“Remember that she needs to drink lots of water and eat three meals a day–and you can\ndo that, too”).\nWhen working with the elderly or people with disabilities, pay attention to factors that\nmay increase their vulnerability to stress or worsen medical conditions. When attending\nto the physical needs of these survivors, be mindful of:\n Health problems, such as physical illness, problems with blood pressure, fluid and\nelectrolyte balance, respiratory issues (supplemental oxygen dependency), frailty\n(increased susceptibility to falls, minor injuries, bruising, and temperature extremes)\n Age-related sensory loss:\n Visual loss, which can limit awareness of surroundings and add to confusion\n Hearing loss, resulting in gaps in understanding of what others are saying\n Cognitive problems, such as difficulty with attention, concentration, and memory\n Lack of mobility\n Unfamiliar or over-stimulating surroundings\n Noise that can limit hearing and interfere with hearing devices\n Limited access to bathroom facilities or mass eating areas, or having to wait in long\nlines (A person who has not needed a wheelchair before the event may need one\nnow.)\n Concern for the safety of a service animal\nPromote Social Engagement\nFacilitate group and social interactions as appropriate.

Reassure them that talking to people, especially about\nthings they have in common (for example, coming from nearby neighborhoods or having\nchildren about the same age), can help them support one another. This often reduces\na sense of isolation and helplessness in both parties. For children, encourage social\nactivities like reading out loud, doing a joint art activity, and playing cards, board games,\nor sports.\nAttend to Children Who Are Separated from their Parents/Caregivers\nParents and caregivers play a crucial role in children’s sense of safety and security.\nIf children are separated from their caregivers, helping them reconnect quickly is a\nhigh priority.

Family members may experience a\nnumber of different feelings: denial, worry, hope, anger, shock, or guilt. They may alternate between\ncertainty that the person is alive—even in the face of contradictory evidence—and hopelessness\nand despair. They may blame authorities for not having answers, for not trying hard enough, or for\ndelays. They may also feel vengeful against those that they consider responsible for locating their\nmissing relative or friend. It is extremely important to reassure children that the family, police, and\nother first responders are doing everything possible to find the missing loved one.\nAssist family members who have a missing loved one by helping them obtain updated information\nabout missing persons, direct them to locations for updated briefings, and tell them the plan in\nplace for connecting/reuniting survivors. The American Red Cross has established a “Disaster\nWelfare Information System” to support family communication and reunification, and a “Safe and\nWell” website located at www.redcross.org. It provides a variety of tools and services needed to\ncommunicate with loved ones during times of emergency. Try to identify other official sources\nof updated information (police, official radio and television channels, etc.) and share these with\nsurvivors.\nYou may want to take extra time with survivors worried over a missing family member. Just being\nthere to listen to survivors’ hopes and fears, and being honest in giving information and answering\nquestions is often deeply appreciated. To help locate a missing family member, you can make an\ninitial review with the family of any pre-disaster plans for post-disaster contact, including school or\nworkplace evacuation plans; plans for tracking transport of students or co-workers for medical care;\nout-of-state telephone numbers to be used by schools, workplaces, or families in case of emergency;\nand any pre-arranged or likely meeting places (including homes of relatives), both within and\noutside the disaster perimeter.\nSome family members may want to leave a safe area to attempt to find or rescue a missing loved\none. In this case, inform the survivor about the current circumstances in the search area, specific\ndangers, needed precautions, the efforts of first responders, and when updated information may be\navailable. Discuss specific concerns they may have (for example, an elderly parent who recently\nhad hip surgery, or a child who needs special medications), and offer to inform the appropriate\nauthorities.\nIn some cases, authorities may ask survivors to give information or other evidence to help the\nsearch. Authorities may have family members file a missing persons report or provide information\nabout when and where the missing person was last seen, who else was there, and what he/she was\nwearing.

In rare cases, a child may need to be\ninterviewed because he/she was the last one to see the missing person. A mental health\nor forensic professional trained to interview children should conduct the interview or\nbe present. A supportive family member or you should accompany the child.

They may believe that they caused the death in some way. Families\nneed to help dispel children’s sense of responsibility and assure them that, in events\nlike this, they are not to blame for what happened. For example, you may suggest that a\ncaregiver say:\nParent/Caregiver We all did what we could to try to save everybody. Daddy would\nbe so happy that we are all okay. You did not do anything wrong.\nNote: Saying this once may not be enough; feelings of guilt\nmay come up again and again, and a parent may need to provide\nconstant assistance with a child’s ongoing worries and confusion\nabout guilt.\nAttend to Grief and Spiritual Issues\nIn order to assist survivors with spiritual needs after a death, you should become familiar\nwith clergy who may be part of the disaster response team on-site, and with ways to\nobtain contact information for clergy of local religious groups to whom you can refer\nsurvivors. It is common for people to rely on religious and spiritual beliefs/practices as a\nway to cope with the death of a loved one. Survivors may use religious language to talk\nabout what is happening or want to engage in prayer or other religious practices. It is not\nnecessary for you to share these beliefs in order to be supportive. You are not required to\ndo or say anything that violates your own beliefs. Often, simply listening and attending is\nall that is required. Things to keep in mind include:\n A good way to introduce this topic is to ask, “Do you have any religious or spiritual\nneeds at this time?” This question is not meant to lead to a theological discussion or\nto your engaging in spiritual counseling. If requested, you can refer them to a clergy\nmember of their choice.\n Do not contradict or try to “correct” what a person says about his/her religious\nbeliefs, even if you disagree and think that it may be causing them distress.\n Do not try to answer religious questions like, “Why was this allowed to happen?”\nThese questions generally represent expressions of emotion rather than real requests\nfor an answer.\n If a person is clearly religious, ask if he/she wants to see a clergy member of his/her\nfaith.\n Many people rely on religious objects such as prayer beads, statues, or sacred\ntexts that they may have lost or left behind. Locating an object like this can help\nto increase their level of security and sense of control.

You can help to orient them.\n You may also provide information to officials in charge regarding space and\nreligious items needed for religious observances.\n If you are asked to join in prayer, you may decline if you feel uncomfortable. Keep\nin mind that joining may only involve standing in silence while they pray. If you are\ncomfortable joining in at the end with an “Amen,” this can help your relationship\nwith the person and the family.\n Many people routinely light candles or incense when they pray. If not allowed in the\nsetting, explain this to survivors, and assist them in finding a nearby place where an\nopen flame would be allowed.\n A survivor may voice hope for a miracle, even in the face of virtual certainty that\ntheir loved one has died. Do not take this as evidence that he/she has lost touch with\nreality or has not heard what has been said, but as the survivor’s way of continuing\nto function in devastating circumstances. It is important to neither encourage or\ndiscourage such hope.\n Every religion has specific practices around death, particularly in regard to the care\nof dead bodies. These issues may be especially complicated when the body is not\nrecovered. Ask survivors about their religious needs in this area. They may want a\nclergy member to advise them.\n In some cultures, expressions of grief can be very loud and may seem out of\ncontrol.

Although emotionally challenging, funerals\nhelp children accept the physical reality of the death which is part of grieving. If not\nincluded, children can feel left out of something important to the family.\n Parents/caregivers should give children a choice whether or not to attend a funeral or other\nritual. They may be encouraged, but should not be pressured.\n Before asking children to choose, tell them what to expect if they attend, including\nletting them know that adults may be upset and crying. Explain that there will be a\nspecial area for the family to sit together (if that is to be arranged). Let them know\nwhat will happen during the service.\n Give them an opportunity to choose the person that they will sit next to at the\nservice. Make sure that this person can pay appropriate attention to them.\n Always provide a way for children to leave the service with that person, even\ntemporarily, if they become overwhelmed.\n Tell children about alternative arrangements if they do not wish to attend, such as\nstaying with a neighbor or friend of the family.\n If they choose not to attend, offer to say something or read something on their\nbehalf, and explain how they can participate in memorial activities at a later time,\nincluding memorials of their own making.\n If possible, bring younger children to the location early so that they can explore the space.\nDescribe the casket and, if they wish, join them in approaching it.

These reactions include:\n Intrusive, disturbing images of the death that interfere with positive remembering and\nreminiscing\n Retreat from close relationships with family and friends\n Avoidance of usual activities because they are reminders of the traumatic death\n For children, repetitive play that includes themes involving the traumatic circumstances\nof the death\nThese reactions can change mourning, often putting individuals on a different time course than\nmay be experienced by other family members. You may want to speak privately to a family\nmember who was present at the time of the death in order to advise him/her about the extra\nburden of witnessing the death.

Medications may be necessary when the survivor is\nexperiencing extreme agitation, extreme anxiety and panic, psychosis, or is dangerous to\nself or others.\nYou should be mindful of the following:\n Exposure to disaster may worsen pre-existing conditions (for example,\nschizophrenia, depression, anxiety, pre-existing PTSD).\n Some survivors may be without their medications, or face uncertainty about\ncontinued access to medications.\n Communication with their psychiatrists, physicians, or pharmacies may be\ndisrupted.\n Monitoring of medication blood levels may be interrupted.\n\u0018\u0018 National Child Traumatic Stress Network National Center for PTSD"

Intrusive reactions are ways in which the traumatic experience comes back to\nmind. These reactions include distressing thoughts or mental images of the event\n(for example, picturing what one saw), or dreams about what happened. Among\nchildren, bad dreams may not be specifically about the disaster. Intrusive reactions\nalso include upsetting emotional or physical reactions to reminders of the experi-\nence. Some people may feel and act like one of their worst experiences is happen-\ning all over again. This is called a “flashback.”\n2. Avoidance and withdrawal reactions are ways people use to keep away from, or\nprotect against, distress. These reactions include trying to avoid talking, thinking,\nand having feelings about the traumatic event, and avoiding any reminders of the\nevent, including places and people connected to what happened. Emotions can\nbecome restricted, even numb, to protect against distress. Feelings of detachment\nand estrangement from others may lead to social withdrawal. There may be a loss\nof interest in usually pleasurable activities.\n3. Physical arousal reactions are physical changes that make the body react as if\ndanger is still present. These reactions include constantly being “on the lookout”\nfor danger, startling easily or being jumpy, irritable or having outbursts of anger,\ndifficulty falling or staying asleep, and difficulty concentrating or paying attention.\nIt is also useful to discuss the role of trauma reminders, loss reminders, change reminders,\nand hardships in contributing to distress.\nTrauma Reminders can be sights, sounds, places, smells, specific people, the time of day,\nsituations, or even feelings, like being afraid or anxious. Trauma reminders can evoke\nupsetting thoughts and feelings about what happened. Examples include the sound of\nwind, rain, helicopters, screaming or shouting, and specific people who were present at the\ntime. Reminders are related to the specific type of event, such as hurricane, earthquake,\nflood, tornado, or fire. Over time, avoidance of reminders can make it hard for people to\ndo what they normally do or need to do.\nLoss Reminders can also be sights, sounds, places, smells, specific people, the time of\nday, situations, or feelings. Examples include seeing a picture of a lost loved one, or\nseeing their belongings, like their clothes. Loss reminders bring to mind the absence of a\nloved one. Missing the deceased can bring up strong feelings, like sadness, nervousness,\nuncertainty about what life will be without them, anger, feeling alone or abandoned, or\nhopelessness. Loss reminders can also lead to avoiding things that people want to do or\nneed to do.\nChange Reminders can be people, places, things, activities, or hardships that remind\nsomeone of how life has changed as a result of the disaster. This can be something like\nwaking up in a different bed in the morning, going to a different school, or being in a\n\u0018\u0018 National Child Traumatic Stress Network National Center for PTSD"

Examples of\nhardships include: loss of home or possessions, lack of money, shortages of food or\nwater, separations from friends and family, health problems, the process of obtaining\ncompensation for losses, school closures, being moved to a new area, and lack of fun\nactivities.\nOther kinds of reactions include grief reactions, traumatic grief, depression, and physical\nreactions.\nGrief Reactions will be prevalent among those who survived the disaster but have suffered\nmany types of losses, including the death of loved ones, and loss of home, possessions,\npets, schools, and community. Loss may lead to feelings of sadness and anger, guilt or\nregret over the death, missing or longing for the deceased, and dreams of seeing the person\nagain. More information on grief reactions and how to respond to survivors experiencing\nacute grief reactions can be found in the section on Safety and Comfort.\nTraumatic Grief Reactions occur when children and adults have suffered the traumatic\ndeath of a loved one.

More information\non traumatic grief reactions and how to respond can be found in the section on Safety and\nComfort.\nDepression is associated with prolonged grief reactions and strongly related to the\naccumulation of post-disaster adversities. Reactions include persistent depressed or\nirritable mood, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, greatly diminished interest or pleasure\nin life activities, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, feelings\nof hopelessness, and sometimes thoughts about suicide. Demoralization is a common\nresponse to unfulfilled expectations about improvement in post-disaster adversities and\nresignation to adverse changes in life circumstances.\nPhysical Reactions may be commonly experienced, even in the absence of any underlying\nphysical injury or illness.

In most cases, continuing contact between\nsurvivors and you will not be possible because survivors will leave triage sites or family\nassistance centers and go to other sites for continuing services. However, loss of contacts\nmade during the acute aftermath of disasters can lead to a sense of abandonment or\nrejection. You can create a sense of continuing care if you:\n Give the names and contact information for the local public health and public\nmental health service providers in the community. There may also be other local\nproviders or recognized agencies who have volunteered to provide post-disaster\nfollow-up services for the community. (Be wary of referring to unknown volunteer\nproviders.) Such information may not be known for several hours or days, but once\navailable, it can be helpful to disaster survivors.\n Introduce survivors to other mental health, health care, family service, or relief\nworkers, so that they know several other helpers by name.\nSometimes, survivors feel as if they are meeting a never-ending succession of helpers,\nand that they have to go on explaining their situation and telling their story to each one\nin turn.

            "content": "Service Delivery Sites and Settings\nService Site Challenges in Delivering Psychological First Aid\nYou can face many challenges in delivering services to disaster survivors and disaster relief work-\ners. These challenges are often related to the specific disaster characteristics (for example, natural\nvs. human caused, size, location) and those of the individuals involved (for example, populations of\nspecial consideration–those with disabilities, youth, disadvantaged groups, individuals with pre-exist-\ning medical or mental health conditions). Other challenges pertain to the multiple settings in which\nyou may be deployed. The following information will be helpful in anticipating and understanding the\nunique challenges of some disaster-related service sites.\nGeneral Population Shelters\nWhen it is determined that a community or area of the community must be evacuated because of dan-\ngerous or threatening conditions, General Population Shelters are opened for the temporary housing\nof individuals. General Population Shelters are usually located in schools, community and recreation\ncenters, or in other large facilities. Shelters usually have limited space for people to sleep, as well as\nan area for meals to be served. Typical challenges include establishing shelter rules (for example,\nlights out, regulated use of showers when in limited supply, meal times), addressing the socio-cultural\nand ethnic issues that arise when bringing diverse populations together, managing public health issues\n(for example, sanitation, medication dispensing, isolating the sick), and resolving disputes that arise\namong shelter residents or between shelter residents and staff.\nService Centers\nService Centers may be opened by a local or federal governmental agency or by disaster relief orga-\nnizations to meet the initial needs of disaster survivors. These centers typically offer assistance with\nlocating temporary housing or providing for the immediate personal needs of disaster survivors, such\nas food, clothing, and clean-up materials. Depending on the size and magnitude of the disaster, you\nmay encounter large numbers of survivors seeking services, and anger and frustration expressed by\nsurvivors in circumstances where there are inadequate supplies.\nCommunity Outreach Teams\nCommunity Outreach Teams are usually established in the event of disasters that affect a large geo-\ngraphic area and/or a significant percentage of the population. These teams are often necessary to\navoid long lines at Service Centers or when transportation services for the general population are\nlimited. The teams are usually composed of two or more individuals that can provide comprehensive\nservices to disaster survivors. For example, a disaster mental health or spiritual care professional may\nbe teamed up with a representative from the American Red Cross who can provide assistance in meet-\ning the survivors’ food, clothing, and shelter needs.\nPsychological First Aid - Field Operations Guide \u00180\u0018"

            "content": "Family Reception Centers\nFamily Reception Centers are typically opened in the immediate aftermath of a disaster involv-\ning mass casualties or fatalities. There is a common recognition that after such disasters, indi-\nviduals may be trying to locate family or other loved ones specifically involved in the disaster\nor separated during the evacuation process. Often these are temporary holding sites until a more\nstructured and operational Family Assistance Center can be opened. Family Reception Centers\nmay be established in close proximity to the immediate disaster scene where individuals arrive in\nsearch of family and other loved ones involved in the incident, or in healthcare facilities where\nthe injured have been transported.\nFamily Assistance Centers\nFamily Assistance Centers are commonly opened in the event of a disaster involving mass casu-\nalties or fatalities. These centers usually offer a range of services in an effort to meet the needs of\nindividuals under these circumstances. Mental health services, spiritual care, and crime victims’\nservices, as well as the services of law enforcement, the medical examiner, disaster relief agen-\ncies, and other local, state, and federal agencies are also offered on site. Family Assistance\nCenters are usually located away from the immediate disaster site. Family members may request\nvisits to the affected site or memorial services. Therefore, the Family Assistance Centers should\nbe close enough to facilitate those activities.\nPoints of Dispensing (POD) Centers\nPODs might be established by local, state, or federal public health agencies in the event of a pub-\nlic health emergency. These centers may be established to provide mass distribution of medica-\ntions or vaccinations in an effort to prevent or mitigate the spread of any communicable disease\nor other public health risk. Healthcare facilities may open PODs with the goal of vaccinating or\ndistributing necessary medications to their own personnel or to reduce the burden on the commu-\nnity POD sites.\nPhone Banks and Hotlines\nCommunities and healthcare systems may wish to set up a Phone Bank to address and respond to\nnumerous calls with questions that typically arise after a disaster. These Phone Banks are likely\nto be overwhelmed in the first few hours or days, with many questions regarding such issues as\nlocating missing or injured family members or healthcare concerns. Community hotlines may\nencounter similar questions and address additional information such as the availability of shelter\nlocations, mass food distribution sites, and other disaster relief services.\n\u00180\u0018 National Child Traumatic Stress Network National Center for PTSD"

            "content": "Emergency First Aid Stations\nEmergency First Aid Stations provide basic medical services to disaster survivors as well as\nresponders who may suffer minor injuries in the rescue and recovery efforts. They are usually\nlocated in close proximity to the direct impact of a disaster. In the event of a disaster resulting in\nmass casualties, makeshift emergency first aid stations may be set up near a healthcare facility in\nan effort to relieve the burden on emergency room services and ensure that such high level care\nis available to the seriously injured.\nHospitals and Hospital Emergency Room Settings\nDuring a mass casualty event, survivors who are triaged on site and listed as “immediate” will\nbe brought to a hospital. In addition, many others will self-transport to the hospital wanting to\nbe seen in the Emergency Room. This is likely to create a surge on medical resource capacity.\nSurvivors may arrive in large numbers, many with both psychological and physical reactions.\nOne important goal is to facilitate the treatment of injured survivors by removing individuals\nwho do not require immediate medical care from the patient flow. However, increased physical\nsymptoms have frequently been reported after disasters, particularly among those who witness\ninjury and death, and those who may have had toxic exposure to a chemical or biological attack.\nAs a result, differential diagnosis may at times be difficult, since signs and symptoms may be\nnonspecific and/or status may change over time. News or rumors of such an attack may generate\nan influx of those who fear they have been exposed, and rapidly overwhelm the system. Along\nwith a system of triage, hospitals may set up a “support center” where Psychological First Aid\nproviders can refer those in need to a spectrum of medical, psychological, behavioral, and phar-\nmacological interventions.\nRespite Centers\nRespite Centers are locations where first responders can rest and obtain food, clothing, and other\nbasic support services. They are usually opened where prolonged rescue and recovery efforts are\nnecessary. Respite Centers are usually located in close proximity to the direct impact of a disas-\nter. Typical challenges for Psychological First Aid include limited time to interact with respond-\ners who are extremely busy and tired, and feel a sense of urgency to continue working.\nPsychological First Aid - Field Operations Guide \u00180\u0018"

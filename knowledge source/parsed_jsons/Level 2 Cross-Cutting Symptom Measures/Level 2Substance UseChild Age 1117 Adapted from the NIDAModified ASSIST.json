            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Substance Use—Child Age 11–17 is an adapted version of the NIDA-Modified\nASSIST. The 15-item measure is used to assess the pure domain of alcohol, tobacco/nicotine,\nprescription medicine, and illicit substance use in children and adolescents. It is completed by the child\nprior to a visit with the clinician. Each item asks the child to rate the severity of his/her use of various\nsubstances during the past 2 weeks.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (i.e., 0=not at all; 1=less than a day or two;\n2=several days; 3=more than half the days; 4=nearly every day). The clinician is asked to review the\nscore of each item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the raw score for each item\nin the section provided for “Clinician Use.” Scores on the individual items should be interpreted\nindependently because each item inquires about the use of a distinct substance. The rating of multiple\nitems at scores greater than 0 indicates greater severity and complexity of substance use.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the child’s use of alcohol, tobacco/nicotine, prescription or illicit\nsubstance over time, the measure be may completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated,\ndepending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high scores on the\nmeasure may indicate significant and problematic areas for the child that might warrant further\nassessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.\nCourtesy of National Institute on Drug Abuse.\nThis material may be reproduced without permission by clinicians for use with their own patients."

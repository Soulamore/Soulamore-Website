            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Somatic Symptom—Adult measure is an adaptation of the 15-item Patient Health\nQuestionnaire Physical Symptoms (PHQ-15) that assesses the domain of somatic symptoms. The measure is\ncompleted by the individual (or his or her informant) prior to a visit with the clinician. If the individual is of\nimpaired capacity and unable to complete the form (e.g., an individual with dementia), a knowledgeable\ninformant may complete the measure. Each item asks the individual (or informant) to rate the severity of the\nindividual’s somatic symptom during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the PHQ-15 is rated on a 3-point scale (0=not bothered at all; 1=bothered a little; 2= bothered a\nlot). The total score can range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater severity of somatic\nsymptoms. The clinician is asked review the score of each item on the measure during the clinical interview\nand indicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 15\nitems should be summed to obtain a total raw score and interpreted using the Interpretation Table for the\nPHQ-15 Somatic Symptom Severity scale below:\nInterpretation Table for the PHQ-15 Somatic Symptom Severity scale\nLevels of Somatic Symptom Severity PHQ-15 Score\nMinimal 0-4\nLow 5-9\nMedium 10-14\nHigh 15-30\nNote: If 4 or more items are left unanswered on the PHQ-15 (i.e., more than 25% of the total items are\nmissing) the total score should not be calculated. As such, the individual (or informant) should be encouraged\nto complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 to 3 items are left unanswered, you should prorate the raw\nscore by first summing scores of items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Next, multiply the\npartial raw score by the total number of items on the measure (i.e., 15). Finally, divide the value by the\nnumber of items that were actually answered to obtain the prorated total raw score.\nProrated Score = (Partial Raw Score x number of items on the PHQ-15)\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nThe prorated total raw score should be interpreted using the Interpretation Table for the PHQ-15 Somatic\nSymptom Severity scale above.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the individual’s somatic symptom over time, the measure may be completed\nat regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and\ntreatment status. For an individual of impaired capacity, it is preferred that completion of the measure at\nfollow-up appointments is by the same knowledgeable informant. Consistently high scores on a particular\ndomain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the patient that might warrant further assessment,\ntreatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision."

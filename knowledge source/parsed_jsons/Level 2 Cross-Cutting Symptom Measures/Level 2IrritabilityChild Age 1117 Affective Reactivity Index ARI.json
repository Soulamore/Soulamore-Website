            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Irritability—Child Age 11–17 is an adapted version of the Affective Reactivity Index\n(ARI) that assesses the pure domain of irritability. The original version of the ARI, which was validated in\nchildren ages 6–17, uses the same items as above but includes a past 6-month time frame.1 The ARI with a 6-\nmonth time frame may be appropriate for use when first evaluating a patient and might be helpful in\ndifferential diagnosis (e.g., disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, oppositional defiant disorder). The\nadapted version of the ARI that was used in the DSM-5 Field Trial used a current state (i.e., past 7-day) time\nframe, and is intended to be part of the battery of cross-cutting Level 2 measures for assessing treatment\nresponse. The child-rated cross-cutting measures are completed by the child prior to each of the child’s visits\nwith the clinician. Each item asks the child to rate the severity of his or her irritability during the past 7 days.\nThe 7-day, current state time frame was not validated by the developers of the ARI1 but was found to be\nreliable in conjunction with the Level 1 cross-cutting measure in the DSM-5 field trials.2\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the scale is rated on a 3-point scale (0=not true; 1=somewhat true; 2= certainly true). The\nclinician is asked to review the score on each item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate\nthe raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the first six items are\nsummed to obtain a total raw score that ranges from 0 to 12. Higher scores indicate greater severity of\nirritability. In addition, the clinician is asked to calculate and use the average total score. The average total\nscore reduces the overall score to a 3-point scale, which allows the clinician to think of the child’s irritability in\nterms of none (0), mild-moderate (1), or moderate-severe (2). The use of the average total score was found to\nbe reliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to the clinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials.2 The average total score\nis calculated by dividing the raw total score by 6 (i.e., the first 6 items on the measure).\nNote: If 2 or more of the first 6 items are left unanswered on the irritability measure (i.e., more than 25% of\nthe total items are missing), the scores should not be used. Therefore, the child should be encouraged to\ncomplete all of the items on the measure. If 1 item of the first 6 items is left unanswered, you are asked to\nprorate the raw score by first summing the scores of the 5 items that were answered to get a partial raw\nscore. Next, multiply the partial raw score by 6. Finally, divide the value by the number of items that were\nactually answered (i.e., 5) to obtain the prorated total raw score.\nProrated Score = (Partial Raw Score x number of items on the ARI)\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the child’s irritability over time, the measure may be completed at regular\nintervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status.\nConsistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the child\nthat might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your\ndecision.\n1 Stringaris A, Goodman R, Ferdinando S, Razdan V, Muhrer E, Leibenluft E, Brotman MA.

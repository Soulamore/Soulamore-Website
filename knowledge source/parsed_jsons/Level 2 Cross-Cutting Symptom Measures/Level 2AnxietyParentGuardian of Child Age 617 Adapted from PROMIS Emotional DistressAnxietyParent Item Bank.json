            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Anxiety—Parent/Guardian of Child Age 6–17 measure is the 10-item PROMIS Anxiety Form that\nassesses the pure domain of anxiety in children and adolescents. The measure is completed by the parent or guardian\nabout the child prior to a visit with the clinician. Each item asks the parent or guardian to rate the severity of his or her\nchild’s anxiety during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=almost never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=almost\nalways) with a range in score from 10 to 50 with higher scores indicating greater severity of anxiety. The clinician is\nasked to review the score on each item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the raw score for each\nitem in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 10 items should be summed to obtain a total raw\nscore. Next, the T-score table should be used to identify the T-score associated with the total raw score and the\ninformation entered in the T-score row on the measure.\nScore T-Score SE Score T-Score SE Note: This look-up table works only if all items on the form are\nanswered. If 75% or more of the questions have been\n10 34.4 5.6 31 66.9 2.9\nanswered, you are asked to prorate the raw score and then look\n11 39.4 4.3 32 67.9 2.9\nup the conversion to T-Score. The formula to prorate the partial\n12 42.3 3.9 33 68.9 2.9\nraw score to Total Raw Score is:\n13 44.6 3.5 34 70 2.9\n14 46.5 3.2 35 71 2.8 (Raw sum x number of items on the short form)\n15 48.2 3.1 36 72 2.8 Number of items that were actually answered\n16 49.7 2.9 37 73 2.8\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\n17 51.1 2.9 38 73.9 2.8\nFor example, if 9 of 10 items were answered and the sum of\n18 52.4 2.8 39 74.9 2.8\nthose 9 responses was 28, the prorated raw score would be 28 X\n19 53.6 2.8 40 75.9 2.8\n10/9 = 31, after rounding. The T-score in this example would be\n20 54.8 2.7 41 76.9 2.8 66.9.\n21 55.9 2.7 42 77.9 2.8\n22 57.1 2.7 43 79 2.8 The T-scores are interpreted as follows:\n23 58.2 2.8 44 80 2.8\nLess than 55 = None to slight\n24 59.3 2.8 45 81.2 2.9\n55.0—59.9 = Mild\n25 60.4 2.8 46 82.4 3\n60.0—69.9 = Moderate\n26 61.5 2.8 47 83.6 3.1\n70 and over = Severe\n27 62.6 2.8 48 85 3.2\n28 63.7 2.9 49 86.6 3.2 If more than 25% of the total items (in this case more than 2)\n29 64.8 2.9 50 88.8 3.3 are missing a response, the scores should not be used.\nTherefore, the parent or guardian should be encouraged to\n30 65.8 2.9\ncomplete all of the items on the measure.\n©2008-2012 PROMIS Health Organization (PHO)\nand PROMIS Cooperative Group.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the child’s anxiety over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals as\nclinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status. For consistency, it is\npreferred that completion of the measures at follow-up appointments is by the same parent or guardian. Consistently\nhigh scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the child that might warrant\nfurther assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.\nInstructions, scoring, and frequency of use on this page only: Copyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

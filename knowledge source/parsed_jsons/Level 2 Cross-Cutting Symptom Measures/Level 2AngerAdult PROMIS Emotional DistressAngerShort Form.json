            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Anger—Adult measure is a 5-item version of the PROMIS Anger Short Form that assesses the pure\ndomain of anger in individuals age 18 and older. The measure is completed by the individual prior to a visit with the clinician.\nIf the individual receiving care is of impaired capacity and unable to complete the form (e.g., an individual with dementia), a\nknowledgeable informant may complete the measure as done in the DSM-5 Field Trials. However, the PROMIS Anger Short\nForm has not been validated as an informant report scale by the PROMIS group. Each item asks the individual receiving care\n(or informant) to rate the severity of the individual’s anger during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always) with a range\nin score from 5 to 25 with higher scores indicating greater severity of anger. The clinician is asked to review the score on each\nitem on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the raw score for each\nRaw item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 5 items should\nT-Score SE\nScore be summed to obtain a total raw score. Next, the T-score table should be used to\n5 32.9 5.3 identify the T-score associated with the individual’s total raw score and the\ninformation entered in the T-score row on the measure.\n6 38.1 4\n7 41.3 3.7\nNote: This look-up table works only if all items on the form are answered. If 75% or\n8 44 3.5\nmore of the questions have been answered; you are asked to prorate the raw score\n9 46.3 3.4 and then look up the conversion to T-Score. The formula to prorate the partial raw\n10 48.4 3.3 score to Total Raw Score is:\n11 50.5 3.3\n(Raw sum x number of items on the short form)\n12 52.6 3.2\nNumber of items that were actually answered\n13 54.7 3.2\n14 56.7 3.2 If the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number. For example, if 4 of 5\n15 58.8 3.2 items were answered and the sum of those 4 responses was 15, the prorated raw\nscore would be 15 X 5/4 = 18.75. The T-score in this example would be that T-score\n16 60.8 3.2\nassociated with the rounded whole number raw score (in this case 19, for a T-score of\n17 62.9 3.2\n67.2).\n18 65 3.2\n19 67.2 3.2 The T-scores are interpreted as follows:\n20 69.4 3.3\nLess than 55 = None to slight\n21 71.7 3.3\n55.0—59.9 = Mild\n22 74.1 3.3\n60.0—69.9 = Moderate\n23 76.8 3.4 70 and over = Severe\n24 79.7 3.5\nNote: If more than 25% of the total items on the measure are missing the scores\n25 83.3 3.9\nshould not be used. Therefore, the individual receiving care (or informant) should be\n©2008-2012 PROMIS Health Organization\n(PHO) and PROMIS Cooperative Group. encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the individual’s anger over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals as\nclinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and treatment status. For individuals with\nimpaired capacity, it is preferred that completion of the measures at follow-up appointments is by the same knowledgeable\ninformant. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the individual\nthat might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.\nInstructions, scoring, and frequency of use on this page only: Copyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

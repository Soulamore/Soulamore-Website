            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Anxiety—Adult measure is the 7-item PROMIS Anxiety Short Form that assesses the pure domain of\nanxiety in individuals age 18 and older. The measure is completed by the individual prior to a visit with the clinician. If the\nindividual receiving care is of impaired capacity and unable to complete the form (e.g., an individual with dementia), a\nknowledgeable informant may complete the measure as done in the DSM-5 Field Trials. However, the PROMIS Anxiety Short\nForm has not been validated as an informant report scale by the PROMIS group. Each item asks the individual receiving care\n(or informant) to rate the severity of the individual’s anxiety during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always) with a range\nin score from 7 to 35 with higher scores indicating greater severity of anxiety. The clinician is asked to review the score on\neach item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for\n“Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 7 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score. Next, the T-score table should\nbe used to identify the T-score associated with the total raw score and the information entered in the T-score row on the\nmeasure.\nNote: This look-up table works only if all items on the form are answered. If\n75% or more of the questions have been answered; you are asked to prorate\nthe raw score and then look up the conversion to T-Score. The formula to\nprorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:\n(Raw sum x number of items on the short form)\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number. For example, if\n6 of 7 items were answered and the sum of those 6 responses was 20, the\nprorated raw score would be 20 X 7/ 6 = 23.33. The T-score in this example\nwould be that T-score associated with the rounded whole number raw score\n(in this case 23, for a T-score of 63.8).\nThe T-scores are interpreted as follows:\nLess than 55 = None to slight\n55.0—59.9 = Mild\n60.0—69.9 = Moderate\n70 and over = Severe\nNote: If more than 25% of the total items on the measure are missing the\nscores should not be used. Therefore, the individual receiving care (or\ninformant) should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the\nmeasure.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the individual’s anxiety over time, the\nmeasure may be completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated,\ndepending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and treatment\nstatus. For individuals with impaired capacity, it is preferred that completion\nof the measures at follow-up appointments is by the same knowledgeable\ninformant. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate\nsignificant and problematic areas for the individual that might warrant\nfurther assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment\n©2008-2012 PROMIS Health Organization (PHO) and PROMIS\nshould guide your decision.

            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Somatic Symptom—Child Age 11–17 is an adaptation of the 15-item Patient Health\nQuestionnaire Physical Symptoms (PHQ-15) that assesses the domain of somatic symptoms in children and\nadolescents. Items 4 and 11 are specific to adults and therefore blacked out on this child version of the\nmeasure. The measure is completed by the child prior to a visit with the clinician. Each item asks the child to\nrate the severity of his or her somatic symptoms during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the PHQ-15 is rated on a 3-point scale (0=not bothered at all; 1=bothered a little; 2= bothered a\nlot). The total score can range from 0 to 26, with higher scores indicating greater severity of somatic\nsymptoms. The clinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure during the clinical interview\nand indicate the raw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” For this adapted PHQ-15,\nif all 13 items are answered, the scores on the 13 items should be summed to obtain a total raw score. The\ntotal raw score should then be prorated to a score out of 30 so that the Interpretation Table below can be\nused to determine the severity of the child’s somatic symptoms. The prorated score is obtained by multiplying\nthe total raw score by 15 and dividing the value obtained by 13.\nProrated Score (if all 13 items answered) = _(Total Raw Score x 15)_\n13\nInterpretation Table for the Level 2 Somatic Symptom-Child Scale\nLevels of Somatic Symptom Severity Prorated Score\nMinimal 0-4\nLow 5-9\nMedium 10-14\nHigh 15-30\nNote: If 9 or fewer of the 13 items are answered on the adapted PHQ-15 (i.e., more than 25% of the total\nitems are missing), the total scores should not be calculated. Therefore, the child should be encouraged to\ncomplete all of the items on the measure. If 10 to 12 items are answered, you are asked to prorate the raw\nscore by first summing the scores for the items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Next, multiply\nthe partial raw score by 15. Finally, divide the value by the number of items that were actually answered to\nobtain the prorated total raw score.\nProrated Score (if 10-12 items answered) = _________(Partial Raw Score x 15)___________\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number. The prorated total raw score should be\ninterpreted using the Interpretation Table above.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the child’s somatic symptoms over time, the measure may be completed at\nregular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment\nstatus. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the\nchild that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide\nyour decision."

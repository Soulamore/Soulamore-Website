            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Depression—Child Age 11–17 measure is the 14-item PROMIS Depression Short Form that\nassesses the pure domain of depression in children and adolescents. The PROMIS Depression scale was developed for\nand can be used with children ages 8–17; however, it was tested only in children ages 11–17 in the DSM-5 Field Trials.\nThe measure is completed by the child prior to a visit with the clinician. Each item asks the child receiving care to rate\nthe severity of his or her depression during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=almost never; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=almost\nalways) with a range in score from 14 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression. The clinician is\nasked to review the score on each item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the raw score for each\nitem in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 14 items should be summed to obtain a total raw\nscore. Next, the T-score table should be used to identify the T-score associated with the child’s total raw score and the\ninformation entered in the T-score row on the measure.\nNote: This look-up table works only if all items on the form\nScore T-Score SE Score T-Score SE\nare answered. If 75% or more of the questions have been\n14 31.7 5.9 43 63.1 2.7\nanswered, you are asked to prorate the raw score and then\n15 35.2 5.3 44 63.8 2.7\nlook up the conversion to T-Score. The formula to prorate\n16 36.9 5.2 45 64.4 2.7\nthe partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:\n17 39.1 4.8 46 65.1 2.7\n18 40.6 4.7 47 65.7 2.7 (Raw sum x number of items on the short form)\n19 42.4 4.3 48 66.4 2.7 Number of items that were actually answered\n20 43.8 4.1 49 67 2.7\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole\n21 45.2 3.9 50 67.7 2.7\nnumber. For example, if 12 of 14 items were answered and\n22 46.5 3.7 51 68.4 2.7\nthe sum of those 12 responses was 40, the prorated raw\n23 47.6 3.5 52 69 2.7 score would be 40 X 14/12 = 47, after rounding. The T-score\n24 48.7 3.4 53 69.7 2.7 in this example would be 65.7.\n25 49.7 3.3 54 70.4 2.7\nThe T-scores are interpreted as follows:\n26 50.6 3.2 55 71.1 2.7\n27 51.5 3.1 56 71.8 2.7\nLess than 55 = None to slight\n28 52.4 3 57 72.6 2.8\n55.0—59.9 = Mild\n29 53.2 3 58 73.3 2.8\n60.0—69.9 = Moderate\n30 54 2.9 59 74.1 2.8 70 and over = Severe\n31 54.8 2.9 60 74.9 2.9\n32 55.6 2.8 61 75.7 3 If more than 25% of the total items (in this case more than\n3)are missing a response, the scores should not be used.\n33 56.3 2.8 62 76.6 3\nTherefore, the child receiving care should be encouraged to\n34 57 2.8 63 77.5 3.1\ncomplete all of the items on the measure.\n35 57.7 2.8 64 78.4 3.2\n36 58.4 2.8 65 79.4 3.3 Frequency of Use\n37 59.1 2.7 66 80.6 3.5 To track change in the severity of the child’s depression\n38 59.8 2.7 67 81.7 3.6 over time, the measure may be completed at regular\nintervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of\n39 60.4 2.7 68 83.1 3.7\nthe child’s symptoms and treatment status. Consistently\n40 61.1 2.7 69 84.6 3.8\nhigh scores on a particular domain may indicate significant\n41 61.8 2.7 70 86.6 4\nand problematic areas for the child that might warrant\n42 62.4 2.7\nfurther assessment, treatment, and follow-up.

            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Irritability—Parent/Guardian of Child Age 6–17 is an adapted version of the Affective\nReactivity Index (ARI) that assesses the pure domain of irritability. The original version of the ARI, which was\nvalidated in children ages 6–17, uses the same items as above but includes a past 6-month time frame.1 The\nARI with a 6-month time frame may be appropriate for use when first evaluating a patient and might be\nhelpful in differential diagnosis (e.g., disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, oppositional defiant disorder).\nThe adapted version of the ARI that was used in the DSM-5 Field Trials used a current state (i.e., past 7-day)\ntime frame, and is intended to be part of the battery of cross-cutting Level 2 measures for assessing treatment\nresponse. The parent/guardian-rated cross-cutting measures are completed by the parent or guardian prior to\neach of the child’s visits with the clinician. Each item asks the parent or guardian to rate the severity of his or\nher child’s irritability during the past 7 days. The 7-day, current state time frame was not validated by the\ndevelopers of the ARI1 but was found to be reliable in conjunction with the Level 1 cross-cutting measure in\nthe DSM-5 Field Trials.2\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the scale is rated on a 3-point scale (0=not true; 1=somewhat true; 2= certainly true). The\nclinician is asked to review the score of each item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the\nraw score for each item in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the first six items are\nsummed to obtain a total raw score that ranges from 0 to 12. Higher scores indicate greater severity of\nirritability. In addition, the clinician is asked to calculate and use the average total score. The average total\nscore reduces the overall score to a 3-point scale, which allows the clinician to think of the child’s irritability in\nterms of none (0), mild-moderate (1), or moderate-severe (2). The use of the average total score was found to\nbe reliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to the clinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials.2 The average total score\nis calculated by dividing the raw total score by 6 (i.e., the first 6 items on the measure).\nNote: If 2 or more of the first 6 items are left unanswered on the irritability measure (i.e., more than 25% of\nthe total items are missing), the total scores should not be calculated. Therefore, the parent/guardian should\nbe encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. If 1 item of the first 6 items is left unanswered,\nyou are asked to prorate the raw score by first summing the scores of the 5 items that were answered to get a\npartial raw score. Next, multiply the partial raw score by 6. Finally, divide the value by the number of items\nthat were actually answered (i.e., 5) to obtain the prorated total raw score.\nProrated Score = (Partial Raw Score x number of items on the ARI)\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the child’s irritability over time, the measure may be completed at regular\nintervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status. For\nconsistency, it is preferred that completion of the measures at follow-up appointments is by the same parent\nor guardian. Consistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for\nthe child that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should\nguide your decision.\n1Stringaris A, Goodman R, Ferdinando S, Razdan V, Muhrer E, Leibenluft E, Brotman MA.

            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe DSM-5-TR Level 2—Depression—Parent/Guardian of Child Age 6–17 measure is an 11-item PROMIS Depression\nShort Form that assesses the pure domain of depression in children and adolescents. The measure is completed by the\nparent or guardian about the child prior to a visit with the clinician. Each item asks the parent or guardian to rate the\nseverity of his or her child’s depression during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=almost never; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=almost\nalways) with a range in score from 11 to 55 with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression. The clinician is\nasked to review the score on each item on the measure during the clinical interview and indicate the raw score for each\nitem in the section provided for “Clinician Use.” The raw scores on the 11 items should be summed to obtain a total raw\nscore. Next, the T-score table should be used to identify the T-score associated with the total raw score and the\ninformation entered in the T-score row on the measure. Interpretations of the T-scores are:\nNote: This look-up table works only if all items on the form\nScore T-Score SE Score T-Score SE\nare answered. If 75% or more of the questions have been\n11 32.1 5.6 34 66.6 2.9\nanswered, you are asked to prorate the raw score and\n12 36 4.9 35 67.7 2.8 then look up the conversion to T-Score. The formula to\n13 38.6 4.6 36 68.7 2.8 prorate the partial raw score to Total Raw Score is:\n14 41.1 4.1 37 69.7 2.8\n(Raw sum x number of items on the short form)\n15 43.2 3.8 38 70.7 2.8\nNumber of items that were actually answered\n16 45.1 3.5 39 71.7 2.8\n17 46.7 3.4 40 72.7 2.8\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole\n18 48.2 3.3 41 73.8 2.8 number. For example, if 10 of 11 items were answered and\n19 49.6 3.2 42 74.8 2.8 the sum of those 10 responses was 30, the prorated raw\n20 50.9 3.1 43 75.8 2.8 score would be 30 X 11/10 = 33. The T-score in this\nexample would be 65.6.\n21 52.2 3 44 76.9 2.9\n22 53.5 3 45 78 2.9\nThe T-scores are interpreted as follows:\n23 54.6 3 46 79.1 2.9\n24 55.8 2.9 47 80.2 3\nLess than 55 = None to slight\n25 57 2.9 48 81.4 3.1 55.0—59.9 = Mild\n26 58.1 2.9 49 82.6 3.2 60.0—69.9 = Moderate\n27 59.2 2.9 50 83.8 3.3 70 and over = Severe\n28 60.3 2.9 51 85.2 3.4\nIf more than 25% of the total items (in this case more than\n29 61.3 2.9 52 86.5 3.5\n2) are missing a response, the scores should not be used.\n30 62.4 2.9 53 87.9 3.5\nTherefore, the parent or guardian should be encouraged to\n31 63.5 2.9 54 89.3 3.4 complete all of the items on the measure.\n32 64.5 2.9 55 90.5 3.2\n33 65.6 2.9\n©2008-2012 PROMIS Health Organization (PHO)\nand PROMIS Cooperative Group.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the child’s depression over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals as\nclinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and treatment status. For consistency, it is\npreferred that completion of the measures at follow-up appointments is by the same parent or guardian. Consistently\nhigh scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the child that might warrant\nfurther assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.\nInstructions, scoring, and frequency of use on this page only: Copyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

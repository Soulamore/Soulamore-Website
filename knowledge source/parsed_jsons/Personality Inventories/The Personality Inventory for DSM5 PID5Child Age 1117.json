These patient assessment measures were developed to be\nadministered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress.\nThey should be used in research and evaluation as potentially useful tools to\nenhance clinical decision-making and not as the sole basis for making a clinical\ndiagnosis. Instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are\nprovided; further background information can be found in DSM-5-TR. The APA\nrequests that clinicians and researchers provide further data on the\ninstruments’ usefulness in characterizing patient status and improving patient\ncare at http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Feedback-Form.aspx.\nMeasure: The Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5)—Child Age 11–17\nRights granted: This measure may not be modified absent written permission\nfrom APA.

            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThis Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5)—Child Age 11–17 is a 220 item self-rated personality trait assessment scale\nfor children ages 11 to 17. It assesses 25 personality trait facets including Anhedonia, Anxiousness, Attention Seeking,\nCallousness, Deceitfulness, Depressivity, Distractibility, Eccentricity, Emotional Lability, Grandiosity, Hostility, Impulsivity,\nIntimacy Avoidance, Irresponsibility, Manipulativeness, Perceptual Dysregulation, Perseveration, Restricted Affectivity,\nRigid Perfectionism, Risk Taking, Separation Insecurity, Submissiveness, Suspiciousness, Unusual Beliefs and Experiences,\nand Withdrawal, with each trait facet consisting of 4 to 14 items. Specific triplets of facets (groups of three) can be\ncombined to yield indices of the five broader trait domains of Negative Affect, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition,\nand Psychoticism. The measure is completed by the child prior to a visit with the clinician. Each item asks the child\nreceiving care to rate how well the item describes him or her generally.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale. The response categories for the items are 0=very false or often\nfalse; 1=sometimes or somewhat false; 2=sometimes or somewhat true; 3=very true or often true. For items 7, 30, 35, 58,\n87, 90, 96, 97, 98, 131, 142, 155, 164, 177, 210, and 215, the items are reverse-coded prior to entering into scale score\ncomputations (see instructions above).\nThe scores on the items within each trait facet should be summed and entered in the appropriate raw facet score box. In\naddition, the clinician is asked to calculate and use average scores for each facet and domain. The average scores reduce\nthe overall score as well as the scores for each domain to a 4-point scale, which allows the clinician to think of the child’s\npersonality dysfunction relative to observed norms.1 The average facet score is calculated by dividing the raw facet score\nby the number of items in the facet (e.g., if all the items within the “Anhedonia” facet are rated as being “sometimes or\nsomewhat true,” then the average facet score would be 16/8 = 2, indicating moderate anhedonia). The average domain\nscores are calculated by summing and then averaging the 3 facet scores contributing primarily to a specific domain. For\nexample, if the average facet scores on Emotional Lability, Anxiousness, and Separation Insecurity (scales primarily\nindexing negative affect) are all 2, then the sum of these scores would be 6, and the average domain score would be 6/3\n= 2. Higher average scores indicate greater dysfunction in a specific personality trait facet or domain.\nNote: If more than 25% of the items within a trait facet are left unanswered, the corresponding facet score should not be\ncalculated. Therefore, the child should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure. Nevertheless, if 25%\nor less of the items are unanswered for a specific facet, you are asked to prorate the facet score by first summing the\nscores of items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Next, multiply the partial raw score by the total number of\nitems contributing to that facet (i.e., 4-14). Finally, divide the resulting value by the number of items that were actually\nanswered to obtain the prorated total or domain raw score.\nProrated Score = (Partial Raw Score x number of items on the PID-5)\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round to the nearest whole number.\nDomain scores should not be computed if any one of the three contributing facet scores cannot be computed because of\nmissing item responses.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the child’s personality dysfunction over time, it is recommended that the measure\nbe completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the child’s symptoms and\ntreatment status. Consistently high scores on a facet or domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the\nchild receiving care that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should\nguide your decision.\n1Krueger RF, Derringer J, Markon KE, Watson D, Skodol AE. (2012).

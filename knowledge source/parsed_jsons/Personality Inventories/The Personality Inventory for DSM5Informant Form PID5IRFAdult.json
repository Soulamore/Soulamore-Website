These patient assessment measures were developed to be\nadministered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress.\nThey should be used in research and evaluation as potentially useful tools to\nenhance clinical decision-making and not as the sole basis for making a clinical\ndiagnosis. Instructions, scoring information, and interpretation guidelines are\nprovided; further background information can be found in DSM-5-TR. The APA\nrequests that clinicians and researchers provide further data on the\ninstruments’ usefulness in characterizing patient status and improving patient\ncare at http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Feedback-Form.aspx.\nMeasure: The Personality Inventory for DSM-5—Informant Form (PID-5-IRF)—\nAdult\nRights granted: This measure may not be modified absent written permission\nfrom APA. This measure can be reproduced, either electronically or in print\nformats, without permission by researchers and by clinicians solely for use with\ntheir patients in private-practice, research, or hospital settings. For the avoidance\nof doubt, this includes that Clinicians may upload this instrument into their own\npre-existing electronic health software systems for patient assessment and\nrecords when done solely for their own use with their patients.\nRights holder: American Psychiatric Association\nTo request permission to include this measure in a commercial electronic health\nrecord system (EHR) or application, to translate the measure, or for any other\nuse beyond what is stipulated above, please contact:\nhttps://websrvapps.psychiatry.org/requestform/default.aspx"

            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe Personality Inventory for DSM-5—Informant Form (PID-5-IRF)—Adult is a 218-item informant-rated personality trait\nassessment scale for adults age 18 and older. It assesses 25 personality trait facets including Anhedonia, Anxiousness,\nAttention Seeking, Callousness, Deceitfulness, Depressivity, Distractibility, Eccentricity, Emotional Lability, Grandiosity,\nHostility, Impulsivity, Intimacy Avoidance, Irresponsibility, Manipulativeness, Perceptual Dysregulation, Perseveration,\nRestricted Affectivity, Rigid Perfectionism, Risk Taking, Separation Insecurity, Submissiveness, Suspiciousness, Unusual\nBeliefs and Experiences, and Withdrawal, with each trait facet consisting of 4 to 14 items. Specific triplets of facets\n(groups of three) can be combined to yield indices of the five broader trait domains of Negative Affect, Detachment,\nAntagonism, Disinhibition, and Psychoticism. The measure is completed by an adult informant, responding about the\nindividual receiving care, prior to a visit with the clinician. Each item asks the informant to rate how well the item\ndescribes the individual generally.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale. The response categories for the items are 0=very false or often\nfalse; 1=sometimes or somewhat false; 2=sometimes or somewhat true; 3=very true or often true. For items 7, 30, 35,\n58, 87, 90, 96, 97, 98, 130, 141, 154, 163, 176, 208, and 213, the items are reverse-coded prior to entering into scale\nscore computations (see instructions above).\nThe scores on the items within each trait facet should be summed and entered in the appropriate raw facet score box.\nIn addition, the clinician is asked to calculate and use average scores for each facet and domain. The average scores\nreduce the overall score as well as the scores for each domain to a 4-point scale, which allows the clinician to think of\nthe individual’s personality dysfunction relative to observed norms.1 The average facet score is calculated by dividing\nthe raw facet score by the number of items in the facet (e.g., if all the items within the “Anhedonia” facet are rated as\nbeing “sometimes or somewhat true,” then the average facet score would be 16/8 = 2, indicating moderate\nanhedonia). The average domain scores are calculated by summing and then averaging the 3 facet scores contributing\nprimarily to a specific domain. For example, if the average facet scores on Emotional Lability, Anxiousness, and\nSeparation Insecurity (scales primarily indexing negative affect) are all 2, then the sum of these scores would be 6, and\nthe average domain score would be 6/3 = 2. Higher average scores indicate greater dysfunction in a specific\npersonality trait facet or domain.\nNote: If more than 25% of the items within a trait facet are left unanswered, the corresponding facet score should\nnot be used. Therefore, the informant should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the measure.\nNevertheless, if 25% or less of the items are unanswered for a specific facet, you are asked to prorate the facet score\nby first summing the scores of items that were answered to get a partial raw score. Next, multiply the partial raw\nscore by the total number of items contributing to that facet (i.e., 4-14). Finally, divide the resulting value by the\nnumber of items that were actually answered to obtain the prorated total or domain raw score.\nProrated Score = (Partial Raw Score x number of items on the measure)\nNumber of items that were actually answered\nIf the result is a fraction, round up to the nearest whole number.\nDomain scores should not be computed if any one of the three contributing facet scores cannot be computed because\nof missing item responses.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track change in the severity of the individual’s personality dysfunction over time, the measure may be completed\nat regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and treatment\nstatus. Consistently high scores on a facet or domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the individual\nthat might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Your clinical judgment should guide your decision.\n1Markon KE, Quilty LC, Bagby RM, Krueger RF. (2013). The development and psychometric properties of an informant-report form of the PID-5.

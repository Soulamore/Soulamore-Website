            "content": "Supplementary Modules to the Core Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI)\nGuidelines for Implementing the CFI Supplementary Modules\nThese modules supplement the core Cultural Formulation Interview and can help clinicians conduct a\nmore comprehensive cultural assessment. The first eight supplementary modules explore the domains of the\ncore CFI in greater depth. The next three modules focus on populations with specific needs, such as children\nand adolescents, older adults, and immigrants and refugees. The last module explores the experiences and\nviews of individuals who perform caregiving functions, in order to clarify the nature and cultural context of\ncaregiving and how they affect social support in the immediate environment of the individual receiving care. In\naddition to these supplementary modules, an Informant version of the core CFI collects collateral information on\nthe CFI domains from family members or caregivers.\nClinicians may use these supplementary modules in two ways:\n• As adjuncts to the core CFI for additional information about various aspects of illness affecting\ndiverse populations. The core CFI refers to pertinent modules under each subheading to\nfacilitate such use of the modules.\n• As tools for in-depth cultural assessment independent of the core CFI. Clinicians may\nadminister one, several, or all modules depending on what areas of an individual’s problems\nthey would like to elaborate.\nClinicians should note that a few questions in the modules duplicate questions in the core CFI (indicated\nby an asterisk [*]) or in other modules. This makes it possible to administer each module independently.\nClinicians who use the modules as an adjunct to the core CFI or who administer the modules independently may\nskip redundant questions.\nAs with the core CFI, follow-up questions may be needed to clarify the individual’s answers. Questions\nmay be rephrased as needed. The modules are intended as a guide to cultural assessment and should be used\nflexibly to maintain a natural flow of the interview and rapport with the individual. In situations where the\nindividual cannot answer these questions (e.g., due to cognitive impairment or severe psychosis) these\nquestions can be administered to the identified caregiver. The caregiver’s own perspective can also be\nascertained using the module for caregivers.\nIn every module, instructions to the interviewer are in italics. The modules may be administered during\nthe initial clinical evaluation, at a later point in care, or several times over the course of treatment. Multiple\nadministrations may reveal additional information as rapport develops, especially when assessing the patient-\nclinician relationship.\nPlease refer to DSM-5-TR Section III, chapter “Cultural Formulation,” section “Outline for Cultural\nFormulation,” for additional suggestions regarding this type of interview.\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

The CFI question that is repeated is indicated in brackets.\nGUIDE TO INTERVIEWER: The following questions address the role of culture in the patient–clinician relationship\nwith respect to the individual’s presenting concerns and to the clinician’s evaluation of the individual’s problem. We\nuse the word culture broadly to refer to all the ways the individual understands his or her identity and experience in\nterms of groups, communities or other collectivities, including national or geographic origin, ethnic community,\nracialized categories, gender, sexual orientation, social class, religion/spirituality, and language.\nThe first set of questions evaluates four domains in the clinician-patient relationship from the point of view of the\npatient: experiences, expectations, communication, and possibility of collaboration with the clinician. The second set\nof questions is directed to the clinician to guide reflection on the role of cultural factors in the clinical relationship, the\nassessment, and treatment planning.\nINTRODUCTION FOR THE PATIENT: I would like to learn about how it has been for you to talk with me and other\nclinicians about your [PROBLEM] and your health more generally. I will ask some questions about your views,\nconcerns, and expectations.\nQUESTIONS FOR THE PATIENT:\n1. What kind of experiences have you had with clinicians in the past? What was most helpful to you?\n2. Have you had difficulties with clinicians in the past? What did you find difficult or unhelpful?\n3. Now let’s talk about the help that you would like to get here. Some people prefer clinicians of a similar\nbackground (for example, age, race, religion, or some other characteristic) because they think it may be\neasier to understand each other. Do you have any preference or ideas about what kind of clinician might\nunderstand you best?\n4. *Sometimes differences among patients and clinicians make it difficult for them to understand each other. Do\nyou have any concerns about this? If so, in what way? [RELATED TO CFI Q#16.]\nGUIDE TO INTERVIEWER: Question #5 addresses the patient-clinician relationship moving forward in treatment.\nIt elicits the patient’s expectations of the clinician and may be used to start a discussion on how the two of them\ncan collaborate in the individual’s care.\n5. What patients expect from their clinicians is important. As we move forward in your care, how can we best\nwork together?\nQUESTIONS FOR THE CLINICIAN AFTER THE INTERVIEW:\n1. How did you feel about your relationship with the patient? Did cultural similarities and differences influence\nyour relationship? In what way?\n2. What was the quality of communication with the patient? Did cultural similarities and differences influence\nyour communication? In what way?\n3. If you used an interpreter, how did the presence of an interpreter or his/her way of interpreting influence your\nrelationship or your communication with the patient and the information you received?\n4. How do the patient’s cultural background or identity, life situation, and/or social context influence your\nunderstanding of his/her problem and your diagnostic assessment?\n5. How do the patient’s cultural background or identity, life situation, and/or social context influence your\ntreatment plan or recommendations?\n6. Did the clinical encounter confirm or call into question any of your prior ideas about the cultural background or\nidentity of the patient? If so, in what way?\n7. Are there aspects of your own identity that may influence your attitudes toward this patient?\nPage 9 of 14\nCopyright © 2013 American Psychiatric Association.

School-Age Children and Adolescents\nRelated Core CFI Questions: 8, 9, 10\nGUIDE TO INTERVIEWER: This supplement is directed to adolescents and mature school-age children. It should be\nused in conjunction with standard child mental health assessments that evaluate family relations (including\nintergenerational issues), peer relations, and the school environment. The aim of these questions is to identify, from\nthe perspective of the child/youth, the role of age-related cultural expectations, the possible cultural divergences\nbetween school, home, and the peer group, and whether these issues impact on the situation or problem that brought\nthe youth for care. The questions indirectly explore cultural challenges, stressors and resilience, and issues of cultural\nhybridity, mixed ethnicity or multiple ethnic identifications. Peer group belonging is important to children and\nadolescents, and questions exploring ethnicity, religious identity, racism or gender difference should be included\nfollowing the child’s lead. Some children may not be able to answer all questions; clinicians should select and adapt\nquestions to ensure they are developmentally appropriate for the individual. Children should not be used as\ninformants to provide socio-demographic information on the family or an explicit analysis of the cultural dimensions of\ntheir problems. An Addendum lists cultural aspects of development and parenting that can be evaluated during\nparents’ interviews.\nINTRODUCTION FOR THE CHILD/YOUTH: We have talked about the concerns of your family.

Immigrants and Refugees\nRelated Core CFI Questions: 7, 8, 9, 10, 13\nGUIDE TO INTERVIEWER: The following questions aim to collect information from refugees and immigrants about\ntheir experiences of migration and resettlement. Many refugees have experienced stressful interviews with officials or\nhealth professionals in their home country, during the migration process (which may involve prolonged stays in\nrefugee camps or other precarious situations), and in the receiving country, so it may take longer than usual for the\ninterviewee to feel comfortable with and trust the interview process.

I would like to understand your relationship with [INDIVIDUAL\nRECEIVING CARE] and how you help him/her with his/her problems and concerns. By help, I mean support in the\nhome, community, or clinic.

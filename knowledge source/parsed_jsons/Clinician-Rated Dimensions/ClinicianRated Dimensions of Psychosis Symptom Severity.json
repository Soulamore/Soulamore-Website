            "content": "Instructions to Clinicians\nThe Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity is an 8-item measure that assesses the severity of\nmental health symptoms that are important across psychotic disorders, including delusions, hallucinations,\ndisorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, negative symptoms (i.e., restricted emotional expression or\navolition), impaired cognition, depression, and mania. The severity of these symptoms can predict important\naspects of the illness, such as the degree of cognitive and/or neurobiological deficits. The measure is intended to\ncapture meaningful variation in the severity of symptoms, which may help with treatment planning, prognostic\ndecision-making, and research on pathophysiological mechanisms. The measure is completed by the clinician at\nthe time of the clinical assessment. Each item asks the clinician to rate the severity of each symptom as\nexperienced by the individual during the past 7 days.\nScoring and Interpretation\nEach item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none; 1=equivocal; 2=present, but mild; 3=present and\nmoderate; and 4=present and severe) with a symptom-specific definition of each rating level. The clinician may\nreview all of the individual’s available information and, based on clinical judgment, select (✓) the level that most\naccurately describes the severity of the individual’s condition. The clinician then indicates the score for each item\nin the “Score” column provided. The response on each item should be interpreted independently when assessing\nthe severity of the psychotic disorder.\nFrequency of Use\nTo track changes in the individual’s symptom severity over time, the measure may be completed at regular\nintervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual’s symptoms and treatment status.\nConsistently high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the individual\nthat might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Clinical judgment should guide decision making.\nCopyright © 2018 American Psychiatric Association.

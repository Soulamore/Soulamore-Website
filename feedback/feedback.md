## 📥 Raw Feedbacks

### [2026-02-27] - Feedback from Helia (UX/First Impression)
> **Context:** Initial reaction to the "complicated" nature of the platform.

**Observations:**
- **Complexity:** "Tbh it looks complicated to me... so many parts that I can't figure out at first try."
- **Cognitive Load:** Users in distress already have "too many voices inside their head." Adding 110+ options feels like "more work for the brain."
- **Core Need:** "Sometimes all you need is a straightforward answer."
- **The Distraction Loop:** "There are many things that you can click on and redirect... I forget what i wanted to do in the first place and i get distracted."
- **The "Scary" Robot:** "These logos/icons look a bit scary to me" (referring to the SoulBot robot icon). Even if it seems like a "random comment," it indicates a lack of warmth in the AI's visual identity.

**Initial Brainstorm Points:**
- [ ] Explore a "Simplified Mode" or "Quick Help" landing page.
- [ ] Implement an AI-driven "Triage" that asks 1-2 questions to narrow down 110 tests to 3 recommendations.
- [ ] Reduce visual clutter on the assessment grid.
- [ ] **Focus Mode:** Implement a "Linear Flow" for assessments that removes external navigation/sidebars once a user starts, to prevent distraction.
- [ ] **Humanizing the AI:** Replace the mechanical "Robot" icon with something more organic or abstract-warm (e.g., a glowing pulse, a soft leaf, or a stylized 'S' that feels like a hug). Rename "SoulBot" to something less "tech-heavy" like "Soul Guide" or "The Listener."
